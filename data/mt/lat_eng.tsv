For at the time when the sun was unable to make the upper part of the exposed body of water hot, despite possessing great heat in his light above, how could he possibly boil the water under such a thick layer of earth and warm it through?

52392	Is pro consule provinciae nequaquam turbidus ingenio; sed quia naves saevitia hiemis prohibebantur, vulgus alimenta in dies mercari solitum, cui una ex re publica annonae cura, clausum litus, retineri commeatus, dum timet, credebat, augentibus famam Vitellianis, qui studium partium nondum posuerant, ne victoribus quidem ingrato rumore, quorum cupiditates externis quoque bellis inexplebilis nulla umquam civilis victoria satiavit.	Piso, who was the pro-consul of Africa at the time, was not someone who caused unrest.

The supporters of Vitellius, who were still fervently loyal to their cause, spread the rumor, and even the victorious party found it gratifying; they were never content with merely winning civil battles, as their greed was insatiable, and not even foreign warfare could satisfy them.

"
What power do we think was present in the persuasive ability of the Cyrenaic philosopher Hegesias? He painted such a realistic picture of the miseries of life that he instilled a longing for suicide in the hearts of many of his listeners. As a result, King Ptolemy forbade him from addressing this topic any further."
29471	nonne triumphum egimus e Scarioth, magnus qui discipulorum et conviva Dei, dum fallit foedere mensae haudquaquam ignarum dextramque parabsideiungit, incidit in nostrum flammante cupidine telum, infamem mercatus agrum de sanguine amici numinis, obliso luiturus iugera collo? viderat et Iericho propria inter funera quantum posset nostra manus, cum victor concidit Achar.	Did we not achieve victory over Iscariot, a prominent disciple of God, who even dined with Him?

Fire originates below ground due to the presence of alum, bitumen or sulphur. As a result of its heat, the soil above it begins to glow.

And to this new favor of yours, your Majesty, you add a fourth degree. In doing another honor, you are disparaging yourself. You give the credit of the excellences of your mind to the efficacy of exterior influence. With greater generosity than truth, you misrepresent those natural accomplishments which you owe to God, to your father, and to yourself as the product of a stranger's efforts.

May he perish who plucked the stake from an innocent tree and crafted the trumpet, which produces mournful tones by being blown through the bones. Such a person deserves to twist ropes, sitting sideways like Ocnus, and feed the hungry donkey forever. Does the heavy breastplate not blister your delicate shoulders, and does the spear not chafe your unskilled hands? I would rather you experience these pains than me suffering from the love-bites that some other girl might give you on your neck. I have also heard that your face looks thin and pale. However, I hope that it's only because you miss me.

67734	Ergo ita novi mores coegerunt, uti inertiae mali iudices convincerent artium virtutes: quemadmodum enim potest calamus vere sustinere tectum aut candelabrum ornamenta fastigii, seu coliculus tam tenuis et mollis sustinere sedens sigillum, aut de radicibus et coliculis ex parte flores dimidiataque sigilla procreari? At haec falsa videntes homines non reprehendunt sed delectantur, neque animadvertunt, si quid eorum fieri potest necne.	On these lines, the latest trends force unfair assessors to criticize exceptional artistry as bland. For, how can a weak tube support a ceiling or an ornamental structure on a roof? How can a fragile and thin stem hold a statue in a sitting position? Can flowers and half-statues arise alternatively from roots and stalks? However, when individuals observe these untruths, they praise them instead of criticizing, without considering if they are even plausible.

38737	vociferans, pulsis vivendi e pectore curis: speravi sceptra Ausoniae pepigique, sub armis si dexter Poenis deus et Fortuna fuisset, ut Capuam Iliaci migrarent regna Quirini.	"He told the gathered senate that they should not count on Hannibal to rescue them. ""I had hoped,"" he yelled, ""that we would be in charge of Italy; and I made a promise that if the armies of Carthage were lucky, the Trojan Quirinus's empire would be relocated to Capua."""

34929	At Iugurtha, cognita vanitate atque inperitia legati, subdole eius augere amentiam, missitare supplicantis legatos, ipse quasi vitabundus per saltuosa loca et tramites exercitum ductare.	Jugurtha, nonetheless, fully cognizant of the foolishness and incompetence of the commander in charge, shrewdly exacerbated his foolishness and continuously dispatched imploring messengers to him, whilst he himself, as though seeking to evade a confrontation, led his army through wooded areas and narrow roads.

68027	Item cum primo aqua a capite inmittitur, ante favilla inmittetur, uti coagmenta, si qua sunt non satis oblita, favilla oblinantur.	Further, when the water is initially sent from the source of the fountain, it is necessary to place ashes at the beginning so that, in case any joints are not adequately coated, they can be filled with the ashes.
68565	et dicebam ego meliorem esse sapientiam fortitudine quomodo ergo sapientia pauperis contempta est et verba eius non sunt audita	And I said that wisdom is better than strength: how then is the wisdom of the poor man slighted, and his words not heard?

But Salinator did not hesitate to assign thirty-four tribes to the lowest category. He did this because they had elected him Consul and Censor, even though they had condemned him earlier. Salinator justified his action by stating that the tribes were either guilty of irresponsibility or perjury if they did not take one of these actions.

He himself, as instructed, selects thirty men, the best from the squadrons. The remaining warriors around him vociferously object: why should they stay in the camp being idle and lazy? Some boast about their noble lineage, some about the accomplishments of their ancestors, and others about their own. Everyone demands a chance, and they insist on it from all sides.
93847	in circuitu impii ambulabunt cum exaltati fuerint vilissimi filiorum hominum	in circuitu impii ambulant secundum altitudinem tuam multiplicasti filios hominum

After the princess was saved by this fortunate chance from the danger of wretched slavery, which, if it had been impossible to ransom the captive, would have branded the state with the greatest disaster, the Quadi, in company with the Sarmatians, roamed farther afield. As they were peoples most skilled in rapine and brigandage, they seized as plunder human beings of both sexes as well as cattle. They rejoiced in the ashes of burned farmhouses and the sufferings of the slain inhabitants, whom they took by surprise and destroyed without any mercy.

Caecilia, who was the wife of Metellus, looked for a sign of favorable marriage for her adult niece late at night, in the traditional manner. However, she ended up creating the sign herself. Caecilia had been sitting in a shrine for some time hoping to hear a divine message that would align with her intentions. As the girl grew tired from standing for so long, she requested her aunt for a place to sit down and rest for a while.

Hence, the people of the north are nourished and known for their tall stature, fair complexion, straight red hair, blue eyes, and abundance of blood due to the moist and cool climate.

Now that Cenwalh had regained his kingdom, a prelate named Agilbert, who was originally from France but had been living in Ireland for a long time to study the Scriptures, came to his province from Ireland. This bishop voluntarily took on the responsibility of preaching and joined forces with the king. Seeing the bishop's knowledge and hard work, the king asked him to become the bishop of his people and remain in that position. The bishop agreed to the king's request and accepted the authority of bishop over those people, ruling over them for many years.

There are, then, with respect to the topography, three simple types of landplain, hill, and mountain; though there is a fourth type consisting of a combination of these, as, for instance, on a farm which may contain two or three of those named, as may be seen in many places. Of these three simple types, undoubtedly a different system is applicable to the lowlands than to the mountains, because the former are hotter than the latter; and the same is true of hillsides, because they are more temperate than either the plains or the mountains. These qualities are more apparent in broad stretches, when they are uniform;
50028	Itaque hercle non minus probari video in te, Secunde, quod Iuli Africani vitam componendo spem hominibus fecisti plurium eius modi librorum, quam in Apro, quod nondum ab scholasticis controversiis recessit et otium suum mavult novorum rhetorum more quam veterum oratorum consumere.	As the author of a biography of Julius Africanus, you, Secundus, have generated high expectations in the public for more similar volumes. It appears that people are just as pleased with you as they are with Aper, who has not yet ceased his exercises in rhetoric and instead spends his leisure time in the style of new rhetoricians, rather than the orators of previous times.

And in presenting this message to the people, I believe that above all else, you must strive with great effort to ensure that the universal belief, which is expressed in the Apostles Creed and the Lords Prayer, which is taught to us in the Holy Gospel, is firmly implanted in the memory of all those under your authority.

And because we believe that the vital sense resides in the entire body and observe that the body is enlivened as a whole, if the body is suddenly divided in two by a swift blow so as to separate the two parts, there is no question that the spirit will also be separated, cleaved and divided along with the body.

48684	Caesar paulisper ad spem erectus, dein fesso corpore, ubi finis aderat, adsistentis amicos in hunc modum adloquitur: Si fato concederem, iustus mihi dolor etiam adversus deos esset, quod me parentibus, liberis, patriae intra iuventam praematuro exitu raperent: nunc scelere Pisonis et Plancinae interceptus ultimas preces pectoribus vestris relinquo: referatis patri ac fratri, quibus acerbitatibus dilaceratus, quibus insidiis circumventus miserrimam vitam pessima morte finierim.	"For a moment, Caesar regained his hope. Then, his powers weakened and he spoke to his friends, while standing at his bedtime just before the end, with the following declaration, ""If I were dying a natural death, I would have had justifiable grievance against Heaven for taking me away from my parents, children, and country through a premature end in the prime of my life. Now, as I am being cut off due to the treachery of Piso and Plancina, I entrust my last prayers to the care of your hearts. Convey to my father and my brother the agonies that I endured and the betrayals that surrounded me before I ended the most tragic of all lives with the most despicable of all deaths."""
9321	Compressa itaque perversitate damnabili, eiusque auctoribus confutatis, atque animis omnium fidei puritate compositis, sacerdotes beatum Albanum martyrem, acturi Deo per ipsum gratias, petierunt, ubi Germanus omnium apostolorum, diversorumque martyrum secum reliquias habens, facta oratione iussit revelli sepulcrum, pretiosa ibidem munera conditurus; arbitrans opportunum, ut membra sanctorum ex diversis regionibus collecta, quos pares meritis receperat caelum, sepulcri quoque unius teneret hospitium.	Thus, with the heresy being quashed and its creators being completely discredited and everybody's mind being settled with the purity of faith, the Bishops went to the tomb of the blessed martyr Alban to express their gratitude to God through the saint. There, Germanus prayed with relics of all the apostles and several martyrs, and ordered the opening of the tomb. It was his intention to leave those valuable treasures in the same location, believing that the members of the saints who had been received into heaven from various countries should have the sanctuary of one tomb, as they were equal in merit.
63648	hic primum paribus nitens Cyllenius alis constitit; hinc toto praeceps se corpore ad undas misit avi similis, quae circum litora, circum piscosos scopulos humilis volat aequora iuxta.

Time went by and the age for marriage came. This young man, who was alone and had limited resources, was a stranger who left his hometown without his father's consent or knowledge. Despite this, he successfully courted, won over, and married a girl with an equally respectable background and greater wealth. The marriage was arranged through the bishop, who knew that the man was religious, and with the help of the Count, who knew that the man needed support. The mother was not concerned about his finances, and the girl did not judge him based on his appearance.

What happiness you must feel today, divine Nerva, on beholding him whom you judged the best candidate for your choice proving that he is best, and being addressed as such! What joy for you to stand second in comparison with your son!

These theorems are comprehended with immense pleasure that such procedures can offer. We must feel a natural emotion when we examine the impacts of specific causes, particularly when we consider creative innovations. Following careful observation, I hold in high esteem Democritus' works on the Nature of Things, particularly the commentary featuring the cutting of gems. By utilizing optics, he studied the impression of the seal on the ring that he utilized.

Remember that my works solely focus on fish. I discuss which fish are produced through sexual reproduction and which are formed from mud, the frequency and season when females of each species are excited and the males are aroused, how nature distinguishes between viviparous and oviparous creatures (which are called zootoka and ootoka in Greek while I prefer the Latin terms), and much more. Although I do not intend to describe the variety of ways other creatures reproduce, I have also presented their differences, diets, body parts, life spans, and several other essential aspects of science, albeit irrelevant for a courtroom.

Well, the respected man whom I have mentioned earlier halted in our town until the tempest of enraged nations, which had arisen in a dreadful whirlwind from all sides, would exhaust its rage.

Meanwhile, he himself learned from deserters and the local inhabitants about the terms entered into by Scipio and his supporters who were engaged in hostilities against him.

39516	nam repeto, Herculeas Erythia ad litora Gades cum studio pelagi et spectandis aestibus undae venissem, magnos vicina ad flumina Baetis ductores miro quodam me cernere amore.	For I recall that, during my visit to Gades, the city of Hercules, and the shores of Erythia, captivated by the Ocean and eager to observe its tides, I was profoundly moved upon seeing the great Roman generals, encamped nearby on the river Baetis.
91002	et convertet cor patrum ad filios et cor filiorum ad patres eorum ne forte veniam et percutiam terram anathemate	And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers: lest I come, and strike the earth with anathema.

That piece of news excited me so much to return home that no amount of oars or wind could fulfill my desire for speed. My anxiety to congratulate the Republic was paramount to my concern for arriving on time.
830	Verum Constantinus id parvi ducens, avulsam hanc molem sedibus suis, nihilque committere in religionem recte existimans, si ablatum uno templo miraculum Romae sacraret, id est in templo mundi totius, iacere diu perpessus est, dum translationi pararentur utilia.	But Constantine, disregarding the value of the pillar in the original temple, removed the immense structure from its foundation. He believed that he was not committing sacrilege by transferring this wonder from one temple to Rome, for the purpose of consecrating it in the temple of the entire world. He allowed it to remain in its position for an extended duration until the requirements for the transportation were arranged.
89029	et atrium maius rotundum trium ordinum de lapidibus sectis et unius ordinis dolata cedro necnon et in atrio domus Domini interiori et in porticu domus	And the great court was made round with three rows of hewed stones, and one row of planks of cedar, which also was observed in the inner court of the house of the Lord, and in the porch of the house.

61877	Breve ab hoc intercesserat spatium, cum C. Caesar ante aliis provinciis ad visendum obitis in Syriam missus, convento prius Ti. Nerone, cui omnem honorem ut superiori habuit, tam varie se ibi gessit, ut nec laudaturum magna nec vituperaturum mediocris materia deficiat.	Shortly after this, Gaius Caesar, who had previously visited other provinces merely as a guest, was sent to Syria. He first paid his respects to Tiberius Nero, whom he treated with great respect as his superior, and then continued on his way. While in his province, he displayed such versatility that he provided ample material for praise as well as criticism from the panegyrist and critic alike.
66202	Eiusque vela cum sunt per altitudinem mediam mali pendentia, non potest habere navis celerem cursum, cum autem in summo cacumine antemnae subductae sunt, tunc vehementiore progreditur impetu, quod non proxime calcem mali, quod est loco centri, sed in summo longius et ab eo progressa recipiunt in se vela ventum.	Further, when the sails are only half-mast high, the ship cannot run swiftly; but when the yard-arms are drawn up to the tops of the masts, the ship sails with a more vehement course, because the sails take the wind, not near the foot of the mast (which is like a fulcrum), but at the mast-head from which the distance is greater.
80497	dixit ad turbam recedite a tabernaculis hominum impiorum et nolite tangere quae ad eos pertinent ne involvamini in peccatis eorum	He said to the multitude: Depart from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be involved in their sins.
41448	nonne vides, cum vicinis auditur in arvis, quam subitus linquat pallentia corpora sanguis? quamque fluant arma ante tubas? cunctator et aeger, ut rere, in pugnas Fabius quoscumque sub illis culpatis duxit signis, nunc arma capessunt, at, quos Flaminius'sed dira avertite, divi.	See you not how the very sound of his approach drives the blood in a moment from their pale faces, how the swords drop from their hands before the trumpet sounds? You think Fabius a sick man and a dawdler; but every soldier whom he led to battle beneath the standards you blame is in the ranks today, whereas the troops of Flaminius - but may Heaven avert the evil omen!
4540	Quas Tannonius ille cum utriusque sexus genitalia intellegi vellet, sed eloqui propter infantiam causidicus summus nequiret, multum ac diu haesitato tandem virile marinum nescio qua circumlocutione male ac sordide nominavit; sed enim feminal nullo pacto repperiens munditer dicere ad mea scripta confugit et quodam libro meo legit: interfeminium tegat et femoris obiectu et palmae velamento.	"Tannonius intended this to refer to the sexual organs of both males and females but, due to being too shy to say the words explicitly, this skilled lawyer hesitated for a long time and used a strange euphemism. He eventually referred to the male genital as ""the marine,"" which was an unsavory and vulgar term. However, he struggled to mention the female genital in a decent manner, so he resorted to citing a passage from a book of mine which said, ""Let her conceal her private parts with both the protection of her thigh and the cover of her hand."""
28579	cur ventos non ipse rogis, ingrate, petisti? cur nardo flammae non oluere meae? hoc etiam grave erat, nulla mercede hyacinthos inicere et fracto busta piare cado? Lygdamus uratur, candescat lamina vernae: sensi ego, cum insidiis pallida vina bibi.	"Why didn't you summon the winds to blow on my funeral pyre, you ungrateful man? Why didn't you scent my fire with spices? Is it too much to ask for even a handful of hyacinths, an inexpensive offering, or have my grave consecrated with wine spilled from a broken jar? ""Let Lygdamus be tortured, let the branding-iron glow white for that slave: I knew it was his doing, when I drank the wine that foully struck me pale."""
21545	laudantur exquisitissimis verbis legiones quae te reliquerunt, quae a te arcessitae sunt, quae essent, si te consulem quam hostem maluisses, tuae:	The legions which deserted you, which you had called upon, which would have been under your command if you had chosen to be a consul rather than an enemy of the state, are highly praised.
49676	At Iunium Gallionem, qui censuerat, ut praetoriani actis stipendiis ius apiscerentur in quattuordecim ordinibus sedendi, violenter increpuit, velut coram rogitans, quid illi cum militibus, quos neque dicta nisi imperatoris neque praemia nisi ab imperatore accipere par esset.	On the contrary, Junius Gallio, who proposed that the Praetorians be granted the privilege to sit in the Fourteen Rows upon completing their service, received a severe scolding: 'What,' Tiberius asked, as though speaking directly to him, 'did he have to do with the soldiers, who had no right to receive commands or rewards from anyone other than their own commander?'
51847	Iamque castra legionum excindere parabant, ni Mucianus sextam legionem opposuisset, Cremonensis victoriae gnarus, ac ne externa moles utrimque ingrueret, si Dacus Germanusque diversi inrupissent.	They were already preparing to destroy the camps of the legions, and would have succeeded in their purpose if Mucianus had not placed the Sixth legion across their path. He took this step because he had learned of the victory at Cremona, and he also feared that two hordes of foreigners might come down upon the empire, if the Dacians and the Germans should succeed in breaking in at different points.
20885	Quis qui nescierit venisse eam tibi tot dierum viam gratulatum?	Which of them was unaware that she had undertaken a journey of many days to greet you?
30124	Offerre se corpora irae; trucidaret.	that they offered their bodies to his anger; let him slaughter them.
21097	Qui tu vir, di immortales, et quantus fuisses, si illius diei mentem servare potuisses!	Immortal gods, what a man, and how great a man you would have been, if you could have maintained the frame of mind you were in that day!
56081	semineces duplicesque inter sua tela suosque inter equos saevam misero luctamine versant congeriem et longis campos singultibus implent.	"
Cowering half-dead amid their weapons and their steeds they miserably thrust and struggle to get free from the grim pile of bodies, and their gasping cries fill all the fields."
60262	Atticus, qui tunc Titus Pomponius, nunc Quintus Caecilius cognomine eodem, Ego opinor, inquit, incipiam primus, quoniam in me videre coniecisse oculos, et dicam de primigenia pecuaria.	"Then Atticus, who in the past was known as Titus Pomponius but is currently called Quintus Caecilius despite keeping his same cognomen, started the conversation by saying, ""Since it appears that all of you are looking to me, I suppose I should initiate the discussion."""
98300	et ecce talentum plumbi portabatur et ecce mulier una sedens in medio amphorae	And behold a talent of lead was carried, and behold a woman sitting in the midst of the vessel.

65013	Libertas, quae sera tamen respexit inertem, candidior postquam tondenti barba cadebat, respexit tamen et longo post tempore venit, postquam nos Amaryllis habet, Galatea reliquit.	"
Freedom, though arriving late, still noticed me in my laziness, when my beard had begun to turn white as it was trimmed by scissors. Even though it was after Amaryllis started her reign and Galatea had left me, she finally cast her eyes on me after a long while."
38568	undique conveniunt, pariterque opponere cunctos uni ductores iuveni placet, arduus ipse Tifata insidit, propior qua moenibus instat collis, et e tumulis subiectam despicit urbem.	From all sides they came together; and Rome had decided to pit all her generals against that one young commander. He himself set up camp high up on Mount Tifata, the peak that stands near the walls of Capua, and from there he looked down upon the city below.
4936	Verba ipsa ad hunc modum se habebant:	Her precise utterances were the subsequent ones:
89073	ponam thronum regni tui super Israhel in sempiternum sicut locutus sum David patri tuo dicens non auferetur de genere tuo vir de solio Israhel	I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever, as I promised David, thy father, saying: There shall not fail a man of thy race upon the throne of Israel.
17861	Si ita feceris, et grossi non cadent et fici scabrae non fient et multo feraciores erunt.	If you do this, the fruit will not drop prematurely, the trees will not be scaly, and they will be much more productive.
58332	ceterum et rex et barbarus atroci ac nova poena iudicis ne quis postea corrumpi iudex posset providit.	He was both a king and a barbarian. Through a terrible and unusual punishment he aimed to ensure that no judge could ever be bribed in the future.
27932	haec mihi perpetuo laus est, quod solus amator nec cito desisto nec temere incipio.	This shall forever be my reputation, that as a lover I never bring an end abruptly nor start lightly.

84342	dicit ei Iesus Maria conversa illa dicit ei rabboni quod dicitur magister	Jesus saith to her: Mary. She turning, saith to him: Rabboni (which is to say, Master).
6123	hinc etiam placidis schola consona disciplinis dogmaticas agitat placido certamine lites, hinc omnis certat dialectica turba sophorum.	They are the tools that peaceful educational institutions use to engage in their non-violent philosophical battles. The entire group of rhetoricians relies on them for their verbose debates.
31419	Nec Persae inulti cadebant; quippe non universae acies quam hae tumultuariae manus vehementius iniere certamen.	But the Persians were not defeated without retaliation, as these unorganized troops did not enter the battle with any less ferocity than the rest of the armies.
44920	ergo ut erat lacrimis lapsoque inhonorus amictu ante Iovem (et tunc forte polum secretus habebat) constitit, haud umquam facie conspectus in illa (nec causae latuere patrem), supplexque profatur: exscindisne tuas, divum sator optime, Thebas? saeva adeo coniunx? nec te telluris amatae deceptique laris miseret cinerumque meorum?.	"So, just as he was, crying and with messy clothes, he stood in front of Jupiter - who happened to be alone in his divine residence - in a way that had never been seen before (and the reason for this was not unknown to his father). He spoke as a humble petitioner: ""Most excellent father of the gods, are you destroying your own city of Thebes? Is your wife so cruel? Do you have no pity for the dear land and the hearth that you once deceived, and for my ashes?"""
47365	quo rumorem reconciliationis efficeret acciperetque Agrippina, facili feminarum credulitate ad gaudia.	His intention was to spread a false story of reconciliation. Agrippina, being of the female sex and thus easily believing in what pleases her, will most likely accept it.
1	Post emensos insuperabilis expeditionis eventus, languentibus partium animis, quas periculorum varietas fregerat et laborum, nondum tubarum cessante clangore, vel milite locato per stationes hibernas, fortunae saevientis procellae tempestates alias rebus infudere communibus, per multa illa et dira facinora Caesaris Galli, qui ex squalore imo miseriarum, in aetatis adultae primitiis, ad principale culmen insperato saltu provectus, ultra terminos potestatis delatae procurrens, asperitate nimia cuncta foedabat.	After enduring an unbearable campaign, in which both parties had their spirits broken by the many dangers and hardships they faced, new troubles were brought upon the commonwealth by the infamous misdeeds of Gallus Caesar. These storms arrived before the sound of the trumpets had faded or the soldiers had been sent to their winter quarters. Caesar had been elevated to a high position from his previously lowly state, but with excessive violence he exceeded his authority, causing turmoil everywhere.
10798	Porro regina nomine Eabae in sua, id est, Huicciorum provincia, fuerat baptizata.	Furthermore, it should be noted that the queen by the name of Eaba had undergone baptism in her native land, specifically in the province of the Hwiccas.
71094	cui soror pueri vis inquit ut vadam et vocem tibi hebraeam mulierem quae nutrire possit infantulum	And the child's sister said to her: Shall I go, and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe?
35071	Nam plerosque iacula tormentis aut manu emissa volnerabant parique periculo sed fama inpari boni atque ignavi erant.	For javelins that were thrown from engines or by hand, quite a few people were wounded, and both brave men and cowards shared equal danger, but unequal reputation.

Shortly afterwards, it is said that Caesar made a remark in which he bragged to Seneca about his reconciliation with Thrasea, and Seneca congratulated the Caesar. This incident augmented the reputation and the hazards of those noteworthy individuals.

A second group includes individuals who claim to be knowledgeable about the law, which has been rendered impotent by contradictory statutes. They remain silent, as if their tongues were tied, and so are perpetually silent, much like their own shadows.

14239	quod nomen a similitudine litterae cepit: nam pars quaedam fluminis Nili derivata duobus itineribus paulatim medium inter se spatium relinquens diversissimo ad litus intervallo mari coniungitur.	The place got its name because it looked like the letter 'Y'; a specific area of the Nile River divides into two branches which gradually move away from each other, but at the coast where the river meets the sea, they are far apart.
12404	Num mentem firma sibi ratione cohaerentem de statu propriae quietis amovebis?	Can you ever disturb the natural calm of a mind made whole and one by firm reason?
28520	et satis una malae potuit mors esse puellae, quae voluit flammas fallere, Vesta, tuas? a duce turpe Iovis mons est cognomen adeptus: o vigil, iniuste praemia mortis habes.	And could one executioner have been sufficient for the wicked girl who dared to betray the sacred fire of Vesta? The hill of Jove took its disgraceful name from this incident. Oh vigilant one, you do not deserve such a fate for being faithful unto death.
24483	sed fugitare decet simulacra et pabula amoris absterrere sibi atque alio convertere mentem et iacere umorem conlectum in corpora quaeque, nec retinere, semel conversum unius amore, et servare sibi curam certumque dolorem; ulcus enim vivescit et inveterascit alendo, inque dies gliscit furor atque aerumna gravescit, si non prima novis conturbes volnera plagis volgivagaque vagus Venere ante recentia cures aut alio possis animi traducere motus.	But it is appropriate to avoid looking at images, to discourage what causes love, to redirect one's thoughts, to share one's feelings with someone else, and not to hold them for oneself after falling in love with someone once and for all, nor to harbor concern and stressful feelings for oneself. The pain grows stronger and becomes entrenched by indulging it, the disorder gets worse every day, and the burden becomes heavier if the initial wounds are not treated with new blows and cured while still fresh by engaging in a fling with Venus or entertaining new thoughts.
98330	ego quoque in interitu vestro ridebo et subsannabo cum vobis quod timebatis advenerit	I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared.

100702	audistis quia ego dixi vobis vado et venio ad vos si diligeretis me gauderetis utique quia vado ad Patrem quia Pater maior me est	You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.
65731	hi motus animorum atque haec certamina tanta pulveris exigui iactu compressa quiescent.	These displays of intense emotion, these fierce struggles, will be appeased and settled by the sprinkling of a small amount of dust.
73880	similiter et facta bona manifesta sunt et quae aliter se habent abscondi non possunt	In like manner also good deeds are manifest: and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
11077	Siquidem anno post hunc proximo idem rex, cum temere exercitum ad vastandam Pictorum provinciam duxisset, multum prohibentibus amicis et maxime beatae memoriae Cudbercto qui nuper fuerat ordinatus episcopus, introductus est, simulantibus fugam hostibus, in angustias inaccessorum montium, et cum maxima parte copiarum quas secum adduxerat exstinctus anno aetatis sua quadragesimo, regni autem quinto decimo, die tertiadecima kalendarum Iuniarum.	For the next year following this event, despite strong opposition from his allies and even the revered Bishop Cuthbert, who had recently been ordained, the same king recklessly led an army to ravage the province of the Redshanks. The Redshanks pretended to flee, but lured the king and his forces into a narrow passage among the mountains where they were trapped. There, the majority of his troops were killed and he, at the age of forty after having reigned for fifteen years, also fell on the 20th day of May.
34149	Corpus patiens inediae, algoris, vigiliae supra quam quoiquam credibile est.	His body could withstand hunger, cold, and lack of sleep to an incredible extent.

30013	Inter omnes tamen    eminebat Cleandri furor, qui nobilem virginem constupratam servo suo pelicem dederat.	Among all of them, however, the insane desire of Cleander was the most prominent, who, having attacked a high-born maiden, had given her to one of his slaves as a concubine.
56442	Cuius cum in urbe pulcherrimum templum haberent, Gracchano tumultu moniti Sibyllinis libris ut vetustissimam Cererem placarent, Hennam, quoniam sacra eius inde orta credebant, quindecimviros ad eam propitiandam miserunt, item Matri deum saepenumero imperatores nostri compotes victoriarum suscepta vota Pessinuntem profecti solverunt.	And although they had a splendid temple dedicated to her in Rome, when they believed that her worship originated in Henna, they sent a delegation of fifteen there to propitiate her, admonished by the Sibylline Books during the Gracchan upheaval to appease 'most ancient Ceres.' Similarly, after our generals had gained victories, they often travelled to Pessinus and paid the vows they had taken to the Mother of the Gods.
40061	ille iacit, totis connisus viribus, aegrum in flammas corpus, densum qua turbine nigro exundat fumum piceus caligine vertex.

The opponents rose from their seats and the delegates presented their case. The letter that was mentioned earlier, from the commission of the province, was slowly being read when Arvandus, without waiting to be questioned, shouted that he had dictated it.

But now Vitellius, surrounded by his own soldiers and with even women in attendance, spoke briefly and in a manner suiting his current sad state to an assembly that he called himself.

And, even though in arguing cases he was occasionally unseasonable, by asking at some inconvenient moment what the religion of each of the litigants was, it cannot be ascertained that in the ruling of any lawsuit he was unjust, nor could he ever be blamed for a man's religious opinions, or any other reason, for having departed from the just path of fairness.

In any case, there continued from this point on an oppressive and harsh form of government: because with Augusta still alive, there had been a haven; since respect for his mother was deeply ingrained in Tiberius, and Sejanus did not dare to put himself before the power of a parent. But now, as if released from the restraint, they burst forth unrestrained, and a letter condemning Agrippina and Nero was sent to Rome; it was generally believed that it had been delivered much earlier and silenced by the former empress, as it was read aloud in public not long after her death.

59994	quidam metiuntur fere diebus XXX. Tertium genus seminis, quod ex arbore per surclos defertur in terram, si in humum demittitur, in quibusdam est videndum ut eo tempore sit deplantatum, quo oportet (id fit tum, antequam gemmare aut florere quid incipit); et quae de arbore transferas ut ea deplantes potius quam defringas, quod plantae solum stabilius, quo latius aut radices facilius mittit.	Some experts permit approximately 30 days for such plantation. If you transfer shoots from a tree into the ground using the third method, be cautious about burying it in the soil. For some shoots, it is necessary to remove them at the right time, which is before they exhibit any indication of budding or blossoming. Also, you should tear it from the stock instead of breaking off a limb as the heel of a shoot is steadier, and if it is wider, it will more easily grow roots.

But it was not the same when he had banished the cold and had begun to enjoy his hosts generous attentions with delight. The Satyr was anxious to showcase their way of life in the country by constantly bringing out and serving all the finest foods that the woodland yielded. In addition, he placed before him a bowl full of warm wine to loosen the chilliness of his limbs with its pervasive heat.

Since the revered Augustus had not prohibited the building of a temple in Pergamum to honor himself and the City of Rome, and as I regard all his actions and words as law, I imitated the example that had already been endorsed by him.

For one who comes from Gaul, the journey down this road is treacherous due to the sheer incline and overhanging cliffs on either side.

The only solution to avoid destruction is to bind a number of vehicles together with heavy ropes and have men or oxen hold them back from behind at a very slow pace. In this way, they are able to descend more safely.

Labienus, upon receiving the news of Sabinus' death and the destruction of the cohorts - with all of the Treviri's forces against him, began to fear flight if he left camp during winter.

28425	hinc animi venere Deci Brutique secures, vexit et ipsa sui Caesaris arma Venus, si modo Avernalis tremulae cortina Sibyllae dixit Aventino rura pianda Remo, aut si Pergameae sero rata carmina vatis longaevum ad Priami vera fuere caput: dicam: Troia, cades et Troica Roma resurges! et maris et terrae regna superba cano.	"Then came the heroism of Decius and the axes of Brutus, and Venus herself bore her Caesars arms, if indeed the Avernian tripod of the quaking Sibyl told that its fields were to be sanctified by the blood of Remus of the Aventine, or if the predictions of the Trojan prophetess, late fulfilled, were truly announced to the aged Priam.

When the Germans were expressing their anger towards their prisoners, Caldus Caelius, a young man deserving of his excellent lineage, performed a heroic deed.

Those individuals, with no hope for advancement in their own lives, adopt a philosophical attitude while drinking wine and praise the idle lifestyle of those who do not hold a position of powernot out of an aspiration for excellence, but out of sheer, immoral sloth.

65906	Ac fortasse mirum videbitur inperitis hominibus posse naturam tantum numerum doctrinarum perdiscere et memoria continere.	But maybe inexperienced individuals will find it amazing that the human nature can acquire expertise on such a wide range of topics and remember them.
42221	Herculeos annis aequare labores coeperat assurgens, et adhuc infantia iuxta; iam tamen et validi gressus mensuraque maior cultibus et visae puero decrescere vestes, cum tibi quas vestes, quae non gestamina mitis festinabat erus? brevibus constringere laenis pectora et angusta nolens artare lacerna, enormes non ille sinus sed semper ad annos texta legens, modo puniceo velabat amictu, nunc herbas imitante sinu, nunc dulce rubenti murice; nunc vivis digitos incendere gemmis gaudebat.	Rising with the passing years, he seemed destined to match the heroic achievements of Hercules, even though he was still a child. Despite this, his steps were already steady, and he was growing bigger with each passing day, causing his clothing to appear smaller and smaller upon him. Yet, your kind master was always eager to provide you with the most fashionable trappings and clothes, with no intention of constricting your chest with narrow mantles or cloaks that would restrict your movements. Instead, he carefully selected garments that were appropriate for your age, dressing you in scarlet robes or grass-green folds, or adorning you with vivid jewels that glittered like fire on your fingers.

Though there have been others who refused most of the honours offered them, no one was great enough before for us to believe that he did not want them offered. This, I think, is more splendid than any inscription, since your name is engraved not on beams of wood or blocks of stone but in the records of imperishable glory.
24499	Atque in amore mala haec proprio summeque secundo inveniuntur; in adverso vero atque inopi sunt, prendere quae possis oculorum lumine operto, innumerabilia; ut melius vigilare sit ante, qua docui ratione, cavereque ne inliciaris.	And furthermore, these negative outcomes are present in a love that involves ownership and prosperity, as well as in a love that is sorrowful and powerless. There are countless negative outcomes that one can clearly perceive, even when their eyes are closed. Therefore, it is preferable to be cautious and heed my earlier advice in order to not be tempted.

19685	Quapropter, ut invitus saepe dissensi a Q. Fufio, ita sum eius sententiae libenter adsensus: ex quo iudicare debetis me non cum homine solere, sed cum causa dissidere.	Therefore, because I have frequently opposed Quintus Fufius with reluctance, I happily agreed to his proposal. The conclusion you should draw from this is that the disagreements I tend to have with him are about substance, not personality.
34477	Hanc ego causam, patres conscripti, quominus novom consilium capiamus, in primis magnam puto.	This, Members of the Senate, I consider as an especially significant reason why we should not embrace a new policy.

48262	Inter quorum aspectus et minas ingressi curiam senatores, et oratio principis per quaestorem eius audita est: nemine nominatim compellato patres arguebat, quod publica munia desererent eorumque exemplo equites Romani ad segnitiam verterentur: etenim quid mirum e longinquis provinciis haud veniri, cum plerique adepti consulatum et sacerdotia hortorum potius amoenitati inservirent.	Under their watchful gaze and threatening attitudes, the senators proceeded to their designated gathering location and attentively listened to the emperor's address, which was being read by his quaestor. Without explicitly naming anyone, he accused the senators of neglecting their duties to the public and encouraging the Roman knights to follow their example of idleness. It was no surprise that representatives from far-off provinces failed to attend when even those who had achieved prestigious positions such as the consulate and priesthoods preferred to focus their efforts on the beautification of their personal estates.
43375	divisere aditus, omnique in limine saevus signifer ante omnes sua damna et gaudia portans.	They divide the paths, and at each entrance stands a fierce flag-bearer, leading in front of all their defeats and their triumphs.

And now, a sudden report that ran through the dwelling of Lycurgus as he was at sacrifice filled himself and his house with tears. Lycurgus himself was filled with tears as he approached from the top of Perseus' mountain, where he had offered portions to the unfriendly Thunderer. He shook his head as he returned from the angry entrails.
49677	Repperisse prorsus quod divus Augustus non providerit: an potius discordiam et seditionem a satellite Seiani quaesitam, qua rudis animos nomine honoris ad corrumpendum militiae morem propelleret? Hoc pretium Gallio meditatae adulationis tulit, statim curia, deinde Italia exactus; et quia incusabatur facile toleraturus exilium delecta Lesbo, insula nobili et amoena, retrahitur in urbem custoditurque domibus magistratuum.	He had found something that even the revered Augustus had not considered! Or was it someone close to Sejanus who was inciting rebellion and causing discontent in order to lure unsuspecting and naive individuals into breaching discipline by giving them nominal compliments? This was the punishment for Gallio's deliberate flattery: he was immediately expelled from the Senate, later banished from Italy, and when accusations were made that he would not be bothered by his exile since he had chosen to go to the famous and beautiful island of Lesbos, he was forcibly taken back to Rome and held under house arrest under the supervision of various magistrates.

So, in such an instance as when Jupiter inflicts the earth with a torrential downpour and electrifying hail, and elevates with his thunderbolt the Alpine heights one moment and the Ceraunianb mountains the next, so that the earth, sea and sky all tremble in harmony and even Tartarus is disturbed in the upheaval of the cosmos.
31289	Itaque illinc plures stare, hinc plures dimicaturos.	Hence, more men stand on their side; more will fight on our side.
84799	Saul et Ionathan amabiles et decori in vita sua in morte quoque non sunt divisi aquilis velociores leonibus fortiores	Saul and Jonathan, lovely, and comely in their life, even in death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.

She, who was frightened of the Trojans' anger due to the downfall of Pergamum, the revenge of the Greeks, and the furiousness of the husband she deserted, and who was responsible for the destruction of both her motherland and ours, had concealed herself and was cowering beside the altars, a despicable being.
61802	Illis etiam detracto capite in longum fortissime pugnandi duravit constantia et desperata victoria in mortem dimicabatur.	Even in the absence of their leader, his men sustained their brave fight for a long time; and realizing that they could not win, they continued fighting until their final breath.
67725	Ita conviviis eorum et, quod poculis et pytismatis effundetur, simul cadit siccescitque, quique versantur ibi ministrantes, etsi nudis pedibus fuerint, non recipiunt fraces ab eius modi genere pavimenti.	At banquets, the wine that is spilled from the cups, or spit out after tasting, dries upon falling. Even though the attendants who work there are barefooted, the wine stains do not stick to their feet due to the type of flooring.
81942	et fecit in Hierusalem diversi generis machinas quas in turribus conlocavit et in angulis murorum ut mitterent sagittas et saxa grandia egressumque est nomen eius procul eo quod auxiliaretur ei Dominus et corroborasset illum	And he made in Jerusalem engines of diverse kinds, which he placed in the towers, and in the corners of the walls, to shoot arrows, and great stones: and his name went forth far abroad, for the Lord helped him, and had strengthened him.

Then Alexander received the envoys of the Athenians, the Rhodians, and the Chians in an audience. The Athenians congratulated him on his victory and besought him to return the Greek prisoners to their homeland. The Rhodians and the Chians lodged complaints about their garrisons.

But during the time in which they remained in possession of the Alps, they claimed that Mucianus would arrive with troops from the east, and Vespasian, in addition, had complete control of the sea and his fleets.

And so, on the eleventh of December, he was greeted with the respectful attendance of the Senate and the unanimous applause of the people. He was surrounded by troops of soldiers and citizens who escorted him as if by an army in line of battle. All eyes were fixed upon him, not only with a fixed gaze, but also with great admiration.

Alas! Are you heartless to stay silent? Is there a threat hidden behind your shameful behavior? Should I, the daughter of a once-noble father, offer prayers and beg for mercy? It seems my father no longer thinks this of me, nor that I am being punished for a mistake and subjected to the anger of a master.
47207	Eius anni principio mollibus adhuc initiis prolatatum inter Parthos Romanosque de obtinenda Armenia bellum acriter sumitur, quia nec Vologeses sinebat fratrem Tiridaten dati a se regni expertem esse aut alienae id potentiae donuin habere.	In the beginning of the year, the war between Parthia and Rome for the possession of Armenia, feebly begun, and till now carried on in dilatory fashion, was taken up with energy.

The Gentiles do not have complete truth because their teacher of truth is not God. Therefore, they interpret good and evil based on their own judgment and pleasure. Sometimes something that was considered good becomes bad, and the same is true with evil, which can change from bad to good.

In front of all his soldiers, their leader stands out wearing the armor of his father. He alternates between throwing a pitchy flaming brand and attacking tirelessly with a stake, javelin, or stone. Additionally, he shoots arrows from his bow that are dipped in serpent's poison and doubly deadly. He takes pride in the cunning arsenal he carries. Similarly, in the war-torn location of the Getic region, the Dacian warrior takes pleasure in sharpening his arrows with the poison native to his land. He then showers his enemies with these lethal projectiles along the banks of the Hister River, known by two names.

24373	tantaque in his rebus distantia differitasque est ut quod aliis cibus est aliis fuat acre venenum.	Indeed, such a significant difference and distinction exist in these matters that what serves as nourishment for certain creatures, may constitute harmful or lethal poison for others.

Many unusual things happened on Earth during that time, with strange creatures appearing that were difficult to classify: the hermaphrodite, possessing qualities of both man and woman but not fully either; some without feet, and others without hands; some mute, lacking a mouth to speak, and some blind, lacking eyes to see; some were even paralyzed, their limbs stuck to their bodies, incapable of movement or escape, unable to protect themselves or obtain necessities.

61547	Quo magis hoc homines timuerant, eo gratior civilis tanti imperatoris reditus fuit: omni quippe Brundusii dimisso exercitu nihil praeter nomen imperatoris retinens cum privato comitatu, quem semper illi astare moris fuit, in urbem rediit magnificentissimumque de tot regibus per biduum egit triumphum longeque maiorem omni ante se inlata pecunia in aerarium, praeterquam a Paulo, ex manubiis intulit.	The return of such an extraordinary general as an average citizen was especially pleasant because of the previous anxiousness that had been felt. This is because, after releasing his entire army at Brundisium without keeping any of his former authority aside from the imperator title, he came back to the city with just the regularly accompanying retinue. There he held a grand triumph for two days which celebrated his victory over many conquered kings. From the spoils, he donated a much larger sum of money to the treasury than any other general did, except for Paulus.

49501	At Agrippina pervicax irae et morbo corporis inplicata, cum viseret eam Caesar, profusis diu ac per silentium lacrimis, mox invidiam et preces orditur: subveniret solitudini, daret maritum; habilem adhuc iuventam sibi, neque aliud probis quam ex matrimonio solacium; esse in civitate, qui Germanici coniugem ac liberos eius recipere dignarentur.	Meanwhile, Agrippina, who stubbornly held onto her anger and was suffering from physical illness, was visited by the emperor. For a long time, she silently shed tears, and then she began to speak with reproaches and entreaties. She demanded that he should aid her loneliness and provide her with a husband. She insisted that she still had the requisite youth to marry and that only the virtuous found solace in marriage. She pointed out that the state had citizens who would gladly receive the wife of Germanicus and their children.

5850	unde insecuto criminum motu gravi donatus aerumnis patris, mox inde rhetor, nec docendi pertinax, curam fefellisti patrum, minus malorum munere expertus dei, medio quod aevi raptus es, errore quod non deviantis filiae poenaque laesus coniugis.	Hence originated the oppressive accusations that followed, despite the fact that your father's grief obtained your forgiveness. Following that, you became a speaker, but your lack of effort in teaching disappointed the expectations of your students' fathers. It was thanks to God's grace that you did not suffer a worse fate, but were taken away in the middle of your life and spared the suffering of your daughter's disobedience and the execution of your wife.
77094	ibique te pascam adhuc enim quinque anni residui sunt famis ne et tu pereas et domus tua et omnia quae possides	And there I will feed thee, (for there are yet five years of famine remaining) lest both thou perish, and thy house, and all things that thou hast.
57957	Nihilo virtute posterior Africanus avo minor, sed ne exitu quidem felicior: duabus enim urbibus, Numantia atque Carthagine, imperio Romano imminentibus ex rerum natura depulsis, raptorem spiritus domi invenit, mortis punitorem in foro non repperit.	The later Africanus was as much of a man as his grandfather, but his ending was not any more fortunate. After he eradicated two cities, Numantia and Carthage, which posed a threat to the Roman empire, he encountered the person who had taken away his breath in his own house but did not find the avenger of his death in the Forum.
48102	Pompeius, Cornelius Martialis, Flavius Nepos, Statius Domitius, quasi principem non quidem odissent, sed tamen existimarentur.	Pompeius, Cornelius Martialis, Flavius Nepos, and Statius Domitius were demoted because they were known to not hate Caesar, yet had a reputation of doing so.

Indeed, it pains me deeply that those individuals who have received the greatest honors that the Roman people can offer did not adhere to the path set forth by Lucius Piso in his exceptionally praiseworthy proposal.
2274	Hic et naphtha gignitur picea specie glutinosa, similis ipsa quoque bitumini, cui etiam si avicula insederit brevis, praepedito volatu submersa penitus evanescit.	Here, naphtha is also produced, which is a sticky substance resembling pitch. It is also similar to bitumen, and even a small bird that lands on it is unable to fly, sinks, and disappears completely.

26429	Opes invisae merito sunt forti viro, quia dives arca veram laudem intercipit.	It is for a good reason that wealthy individuals are despised by valiant men, as a collection of money hinders admiration from being directed to its appropriate recipient.

For his ruling regarding me, whether it inclines towards one direction or another, possesses immense significance; currently, if I am properly informed, since it is in my favor, it consoles me to the same extent that it would petrify me if it were against me.
52406	Redditur Tettio Iuliano praetura, postquam cognitus est ad Vespasianum confugisse: Grypo honor mansit.	His praetorship was returned to Tettius Julianus after it was discovered that he had sought refuge with Vespasian. Grypus kept his position.

In the center of Carthage there was a temple dedicated to the spirit of Elissa, the founder, and it was revered by the people with a sense of inheritance.

And so, the Egyptians and Chaldeans, who were instructed to prepare the King's body in their own way, initially hesitated to touch the body as if the King was still alive. They prayed for permission to touch a god and, after gaining it, they removed the organs from the body, filled the golden coffin with perfumes, and placed the symbols of royalty on top of the King's head.
9241	Exin Brittania in parte Brettonum, omni armato milite, militaribus copiis universis, tota floridae iuventutis alacritate spoliata, quae tyrannorum temeritate abducta nusquam ultra domum rediit, praedae tantum patuit, utpote omnis bellici usus prorsus ignara: denique subito duabus gentibus transmarinis vehementer saevis, Scottorum a circio, Pictorum ab aquilone, multos stupet gemitque per annos.	Henceforth, in the portion of Britain held by the Britons, the entire provision for war along with all men-at-arms and their strongest youth, who were rashly led away by the tyrants and never returned home, were all robbed. The people were completely unaware of handling weapons of war and as a result were left helpless to be preyed upon by invaders. Therefore, for many years, they suffered greatly under the cruel occupation of two foreign nations, the Scots from the west and the Redshanks from the north.
10883	Quae multum diu regem postulans ut saeculi curas relinquere, atque in monasterio, tantum vero regi Christo servire permitteretur; ubi vix aliquando impetravit, intravit monasterium Aebbae abbatissae, quae erat amita regis Ecgfridi, positum in loco quem Coludi urbem nominant, accepto velamine sanctimonialis habitus a praefato antistite Vilfrido.	And she fervently requested the king for a long time to allow her to leave the responsibilities of the world and devote herself to serving only Christ the true king in a monastery.

The monastery is located in the town of Coludi, and she received the veil of a nun's habit from Bishop Wilfrid.

25478	Nihil in homine membrorum est, quod non et necessitatis causa sit et decoris, et quod magis mirum est, eadem figura omnibus, sed quaedam unicuique liniamenta deflexa: sic et similes universi videmur et inter se singuli dissimiles invenimur.	There is not a single aspect of the human body that is not either functional or decorative, and what's even more astounding is that while we all share the same basic form, each person displays unique deviations from the norm. When taken together, we may appear identical, but in reality, each of us possesses our own distinctive traits.
13626	Caesar novo genere pugnae oblato cum animum adverteret ordines suorum in procurrendo turbari'pedites enim, dum equites longius a signis persequuntur, latere nudato a proximis Numidis iaculis vulnerabantur; equites autem hostium pilum militis cursu facile vitabant'edicit per ordines ne quis miles ab signis IIII pedes longius procederet.	Caesar noticed that the enemy was using new strategies, and he saw that his own army's formation was starting to break down as they charged forward to attack. In fact, the infantry was exposing their flank as they pursued the cavalry too far from their standard, and as a result, they were being hit by the javelins of the nearest Numidian soldiers. Meanwhile, the enemy cavalry was easily avoiding the heavy infantry's javelins due to their speed. Therefore, Caesar ordered that no soldier should advance any farther.

The youth dashed forward and plunged into the fray; and just as Aeneas hand rose to deal a blow, he caught up the heros point and checked him by this delay. His comrades follow with loud cries, until the father, guarded by his sons shield, could withdraw; and showering their javelins beat back the foe with missiles from a distance.

Tribune of the Plebs C. Helvius Cinna, while walking back from the funeral of C. Caesar, was mistakenly torn apart by the crowd, who thought he was Cornelius Cinna, the man they were enraged with. This was due to Helvius' relation to Caesar by marriage, and yet having given a blasphemous speech about him from the rostra after his murder. The people, driven by this mix-up, carried Helvius' head on a javelin around Caesar's funeral pyre, believing it to be Cornelius'. It was truly a tragic loss, caused by both his own loyalty to his duties and the people's mistake.

Now pay attention: I will explain in just a few sweetly voiced verses how quickly the images are carried along and with what speed they swim through the air, covering long distances in just a short time, no matter where they are headed or at what angle. This is like the graceful song of a swan, far better than the cackling of cranes that echoes across the southern sky.

4323	Haec ego de forma respondissem; praeterea, licere etiam philosophis esse voltu liberali; Pythagoram, qui primus sese philosophum nuncuparit, eum sui saeculi excellentissima forma fuisse; item Zenonem illum antiquum Velia oriundum, qui primus omnium sollertissimo artificio <argumenta> ambifariam dissolverit, eum quoque Zenonem longe decorissimum fuisse, ut Plato autumat; itemque multos philosophos ab ore honestissimos memoriae prodi, qui gratiam corporis morum honestamentis ornaverint.	The beautiful gifts bestowed by the gods should never be rejected, yet they are often desired without being bestowed. This was my response when asked about my own appearance. Also, I could have mentioned that even philosophers may possess good looks; Pythagoras, the earliest philosopher, was considered the most handsome man of his time, while Zeno of Velia, the first to refute hypotheses by means of self-inconsistency, was also known for his good looks, according to Plato. Many philosophers have been renowned for their physical attractiveness, further enhanced by their moral character.

Though the inhabitants had fled, we discovered one soldier hiding in a remote location. When brought before the general, he gave contradictory answers out of fear and fell under suspicion. However, after being threatened, he divulged the truth; he was born in Paris, Gaul and served in a cavalry troop, but had deserted to the Persians to evade punishment for a past wrong. When it was discovered that he was an honorable man who had married and raised children, sent to our lands as a spy, and had often provided reliable information, he was pardoned.
