But on the other hand if the first-beginnings of things are soft, it cannot be explained whence hard flints and iron can be created; for from the first all nature will be wanting a fundamental basis.	On the contrary, if the beginnings of things are soft, then it cannot be explained how strong flint and iron can be created; for fundamentally, all nature will lack the principle of foundation.	But if soft things are the beginnings of things, how can a strong steel and iron be created, and no reason can be given; for it will lack the fundamental nature of all principle from the very beginning.

For one who comes from Gaul, the journey down this road is treacherous due to the sheer incline and overhanging cliffs on either side. This is especially true in the spring season when melting ice and thawing snow make for slippery slopes.

The only solution to avoid destruction is to bind a number of vehicles together with heavy ropes and have men or oxen hold them back from behind at a very slow pace. In this way, they are able to descend more safely.	For those coming from Gaul, it is a steep and low descent, terrifying to behold due to the hanging rocks on either side, especially in the spring when the ice melts and the snow thaws due to the warm breath of the winds.
