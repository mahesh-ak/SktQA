Socrates: But, O Crito, if it is pleasing to the gods, let it be so; however, I do not think that it will come today.	Socrates.

ἀλλ᾽ , ὦ δαιμόνιε Σώκρατες , ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐμοὶ πιθοῦ καὶ σώθητι : ὡς ἐμοί , ἐὰν σὺ ἀποθάνῃς , οὐ μία συμφορά ἐστιν , ἀλλὰ χωρὶς μὲν τοῦ ἐστερῆσθαι τοιούτου ἐπιτηδείου οἷον ἐγὼ οὐδένα μή ποτε εὑρήσω , ἔτι δὲ καὶ πολλοῖς δόξω , οἳ ἐμὲ καὶ σὲ μὴ σαφῶς ἴσασιν , ὡς οἷός τ᾽ ὤν σε σῴζειν εἰ ἤθελον ἀναλίσκειν χρήματα , ἀμελῆσαι .	But , my dear Socrates , even now listen to me and save yourself . Since , if you die , it will be no mere single misfortune to me , but I shall lose a friend such as I can never find again , and besides , many persons who do not know you and me well will think I could have saved you if I had been willing to spend money , but that I would not take the trouble .	182	But, O divine Socrates, even now obey me and be saved; for if you die, it is not one misfortune for me, but besides being deprived of such a friend as I will never find again, yet I will also seem to many, who do not know me and you well, as if being	But, dear Socrates, even now listen to me and be saved.

καίτοι τίς ἂν αἰσχίων εἴη ταύτης δόξα ἢ δοκεῖν χρήματα περὶ πλείονος ποιεῖσθαι ἢ φίλους ; οὐ γὰρ πείσονται οἱ πολλοὶ ὡς σὺ αὐτὸς οὐκ ἠθέλησας ἀπιέναι ἐνθένδε ἡμῶν προθυμουμένων .	And yet what reputation could be more disgraceful than that of considering one ' s money of more importance than one ' s friends ? For most people will not believe that we were eager to help you to go away from here , but you refused .	183	"""And yet, what reputation could be more shameful than this, that one seems to value money more than friends? For the many will not be persuaded that you yourself were unwilling to depart from here while we were eager."""	And yet what reputation could be more shameful than this, to seem to value money more highly than friends? For the many will not be persuaded that you yourself did not wish to depart from here, though we were eager for it.	And yet what could be more shameful than this reputation or to seem to make money about more than friends? For the many will not be convinced that you yourself did not wish to depart from here while we were eager.	But what would be more shameful, to think that one is making more money or to have friends? For the many will not believe that you yourself did not want to leave us, although we were eager.
Σωκράτης . ἀλλὰ τί ἡμῖν , ὦ μακάριε Κρίτων , οὕτω τῆς τῶν πολλῶν δόξης μέλει ; οἱ γὰρ ἐπιεικέστατοι , ὧν μᾶλλον ἄξιον φροντίζειν , ἡγήσονται αὐτὰ οὕτω πεπρᾶχθαι ὥσπερ ἂν πραχθῇ .	Socrates . But , my dear Crito , why do we care so much for what most people think ? For the most reasonable men , whose opinion is more worth considering , will think that things were done as they really will be done .	184	Socrates: But why, blessed Crito, do we care so much about the opinion of the many? For the best people, who are more worth considering, will think those things have happened as they indeed have happened.	Socrates: But why, dear Crito, should we care so much about the opinion of the many? For the most decent people, whose opinion is more worthy of consideration, will think that things have been done as they should be done.	Socrates. But what concerns us, O blessed Crito, that we are so concerned with the opinions of the many? For those who are most reasonable, for whom it is more worthy to care, will consider these things to have been done just as they happen to be done.	Socrates. But what care we, O blessed Crito, for the opinion of the many? For the most just men, who are more worthy of consideration, will think that these things have been done as if they had been done.
Κρίτων . ἀλλ᾽ ὁρᾷς δὴ ὅτι ἀνάγκη , ὦ Σώκρατες , καὶ τῆς τῶν πολλῶν δόξης μέλειν . αὐτὰ δὲ δῆλα τὰ παρόντα νυνὶ ὅτι οἷοί τ᾽ εἰσὶν οἱ πολλοὶ οὐ τὰ σμικρότατα τῶν κακῶν ἐξεργάζεσθαι ἀλλὰ τὰ μέγιστα σχεδόν , ἐάν τις ἐν αὐτοῖς διαβεβλημένος ᾖ .	Crito . But you see it is necessary , Socrates , to care for the opinion of the public , for this very trouble we are in now shows that the public is able to accomplish not by any means the least , but almost the greatest of evils , if one has a bad reputation with it .	185	Crito: But you see, Socrates, that it is necessary to care about the opinion of the many. It is clear now that the many are able not only to bring about the smallest of evils but the greatest, if someone is slandered among them.	Crito. But you see, Socrates, that it is necessary to care about the opinion of the many. The facts themselves are clear, that the many are capable of accomplishing not the smallest but nearly the greatest of evils, if someone is slandered among them.	Crito: But you see, Socrates, that it is necessary to take care of the opinion of the many. For it is clear that the present situation is such that the many are not able to deal with the smallest of evils, but only with the greatest, if someone has been slandered among them	Crito. But do you see, Socrates, that it is necessary to care for the opinion of the many? And it is clear that the present circumstances show that the many are capable of doing the greatest evils, almost, if one is among them.

Socrates . I only wish , Crito , the people could accomplish the greatest evils , that they might be able to accomplish also the greatest good things . Then all would be well . But now they can do neither of the two ; for they are not able to make a man wise or foolish , but they do whatever occurs to them .	186	"Socrates: ""For if the many could work the greatest evils, O Crito, they would also be able to do the greatest good, and that would be well. But as it is, they are capable of neither: for they cannot make a man wise nor foolish, but they do whatever comes to"	Socrates: For if they were able, Crito, to do the greatest evils, so that they would also be able to do the greatest goods, it would be well. But now they are able to do neither; for they are not able to make a man either wise or foolish, but they do whatever happens	Socrates: For if only, O Crito, the many could do the greatest evils, so that they could also do the greatest goods, everything would be well. But now they are capable of neither: for they are able to produce neither wise nor foolish things, but they do whatever happens to come to	Socrates. For if only, O Crito, the many were able to do the greatest evils, so that they might also be able to do the greatest goods, and it would be well with them. But now they are neither able to do either: for they are not able to be wise or foolish, but

Crito . That may well be . But , Socrates , tell me this : you are not considering me and your other friends , are you , fearing that , if you escape , the informers will make trouble for us by saying that we stole you away , and we shall be forced to lose either all our property or a good deal of money , or be punished in some other way besides ? For if you are afraid of anything of that kind , let it go ; since it is right for us to run this risk , and even greater risk than this , if necessary , provided we save you .	187	Crito: So let it be as you say. But now, O Socrates, tell me this: Are you not concerned for me and your other friends, that if you go away from here, we might suffer trouble at the hands of informers, as having stolen you away, and be compelled either to lose	Crito, let these things be so: but tell me this, Socrates, are you not afraid that, if you go from here, the informers will give us trouble, saying that we stole you away from here, and that we shall be compelled either to lose all our property or to pay a great deal	Crito: Let these things indeed be thus; but tell me this, O Socratic. Are you not concerned about me and the other necessities, if you should go forth from here, that the informers might present matters to us as if they have taken you away from here, and we may be compelled either	Crito. Let these things be as they are: but tell me, Socrates, these: Will you not, and the others who are dear to you, be saved, if you depart from here, and the slanderers will provide us with charges as if you had stolen from here, and we will be forced
ἀλλ᾽ ἐμοὶ πείθου καὶ μὴ ἄλλως ποίει .	Now please do as I ask .	188	But obey me and do not act otherwise.	But obey me and do not do otherwise.	But trust me and do not act otherwise.	But persuade me and do not act otherwise.

Well , do not fear this ! for it is not even a large sum of money which we should pay to some men who are willing to save you and get you away from here .	190	Crito: Therefore, do not be afraid of these things—for indeed the money that some want to receive in order to save you and get you out of here is not much.	Crito, do not, therefore, be afraid of these things; for it is not even a large sum of money which some persons are willing to take to save you and bring you out of this place.	Crito, do not fear these things — for the money is not much which some want to take in order to save you and bring you out of here.	Crito. Fear not, then, these things — for, indeed, it is not a great sum of money that some who wish to save you and lead you out of here are willing to pay.

And do not be troubled by what you said in the court , that if you went away you would not know what to do with yourself .	193	Therefore, as I am telling you, neither tire yourself out trying to save yourself out of fear of these things, nor let it be difficult for you, as you said in the court, that you would not know what to do with yourself if you went out.	So that, as I say, you may not, fearing these things, be too lazy to save yourself, nor may it be difficult for you, as you said in court, that you would not know what to do with yourself if you went out.	Therefore, as I am saying, do not let yourself grow weary in saving yourself, neither let what you said in the court become difficult for you, that you would not be able to exit with what you use for yourself.	so that, as I say, you do not perish, fearing these things, nor, as you said in court, do you make it difficult for yourself, that you would not have gone out, that you might use it for yourself.

And besides , Socrates , it seems to me the thing you are undertaking to do is not even right — betraying yourself when you might save yourself . And you are eager to bring upon yourself just what your enemies would wish and just what those were eager for who wished to destroy you .	195	"""Moreover, Socrates, it does not seem to me just to attempt such a thing, to betray yourself when it is possible to be saved, and to hasten such things for yourself which even your enemies would hasten and have hastened, wishing to destroy you."""

And yet, O Socrates, it does not seem just to me that you attempt to betray yourself, while it is possible for you to be saved, and you are eager to become such things about yourself as even your enemies would desire and have strived to destroy you.	Still, Socrates, it seems to me that you are attempting something unjust, to betray yourself and to be saved, and you are eager for such things to happen to you as your enemies would be eager to happen to you and have happened to you, wanting to destroy you.

And moreover , I think you are abandoning your children , too , for when you might bring them up and educate them , you are going to desert them and go away , and , so far as you are concerned , their fortunes in life will be whatever they happen to meet with , and they will probably meet with such treatment as generally comes to orphans in their destitution .	196	Furthermore, it seems to me that you are also betraying your own sons, whom you could both nurture and educate, but instead you will leave them behind, and they will experience whatever fate comes to them; and as is likely, they will encounter the usual outcomes that occur for orphans in orphanhood.	Moreover, it seems to me that you are betraying your own sons, whom you have the power to raise and educate, but instead you will leave them behind, and whatever fortune they may have, they will manage it as they see fit; and they will likely suffer the kind of things that usually happen to orphans	But in addition to these things, it seems to me that you are betraying your sons, whom, being able to raise and educate, you will depart leaving behind, and whatever will happen to your part, they will do this: they will become like what usually happens in orphanages concerning the orphans.	And besides, you seem to me to be betraying your own slaves, whom you have the power to raise and educate, leaving them behind, and to do with your own property as you please, as long as they are able to do so. They will probably fare, as is usual in the case of orphans

However, one ought to choose the things that a good and brave man would choose, claiming, that is, to cultivate virtue throughout one's whole life	For it is necessary either to raise children or to endure suffering and to nurture and educate them, but you seem to choose the most careless things. It is necessary, however, to choose those things which a good and brave man would choose, saying indeed that he ought to care for virtue throughout all of life.	For is it not necessary to bring up children or to suffer with them and to nourish and educate them, but you seem to choose the easiest things?

My dear Crito , your eagerness is worth a great deal , if it should prove to be rightly directed ; but otherwise , the greater it is , the more hard to bear .	198	Socrates: O dear Crito, your zeal is worth much if it were with some rightness; but if not, the greater it is, the more difficult it is.	Socrates: Ah, dear Crito, your eagerness is worth much if it is accompanied by some correctness; but if not, the greater it is, the more troublesome it becomes.	Socrates: O dear Criton, your eagerness is worthy of much if it were with some correctness; but if not, it is so much greater and more arduous.	Socrates. Oh dear Crito, your eagerness is worth a great deal if it were for something noble, but if not, the more eager you are, the more troublesome.

So we must examine the question whether we ought to do this or not ; for I am not only now but always a man who follows nothing but the reasoning which on consideration seems to me best .	199	Therefore, it is necessary for us to consider whether these things should be done or not; as for me, I am not now for the first time but always such a one that I obey no one else except the argument which appears best to me when I reason.	We must examine whether we should act in this way or not; as for me, I am not only now but always the kind of person who obeys nothing other than the argument that seems best to me upon reflection.	Therefore, we must consider whether these things are to be done or not: as I am not now for the first time, but always such a one as to be persuaded by no one else but by the argument which seems best to me when I reflect.	We must therefore consider whether we should do these things or not, as I, for my part, never for the first time but always, am of the opinion that one should obey no one but the reason which appears to be the best to me when I am thinking.
τοὺς δὴ λόγους οὓς ἐν τῷ ἔμπροσθεν ἔλεγον οὐ δύναμαι νῦν ἐκβαλεῖν , ἐπειδή μοι ἥδε ἡ τύχη γέγονεν , ἀλλὰ σχεδόν τι ὅμοιοι φαίνονταί μοι , καὶ τοὺς αὐτοὺς πρεσβεύω καὶ τιμῶ οὕσπερ καὶ πρότερον :	And I cannot , now that this has happened to us , discard the arguments I used to advance , but they seem to me much the same as ever , and I revere and honor the same ones as before .	200	Indeed, the arguments which I previously made I cannot now dismiss, since this fate has befallen me, but they appear to me to be nearly the same, and I advocate and honor the same ones as before.	The words that I spoke previously I am unable to reject now, since this fate has befallen me, but they seem to me to be almost the same, and I honor and value the same things as I did before.	I cannot now express the statements that I previously made, due to this fortune that has befallen me; but they seem to me to be somewhat similar, and I advocate for and honor the same individuals as I did before.	I am unable to expel the words which we were saying before, since this fortune has befallen me, but they seem to me to be somewhat similar, and I am pleading and honoring them just as I was before.

And unless we can bring forward better ones in our present situation , be assured that I shall not give way to you , not even if the power of the multitude frighten us with even more terrors than at present , as children are frightened with goblins , threatening us with imprisonments and deaths and confiscations of property .	201	If we do not have better things to say at present, rest assured that I shall not agree with you, even if the power of the many, which frightens us like children with threats of bonds and death and confiscation of goods, is greater than those present now.	If we do not have anything better to say at the present moment, be assured that I will not yield to you, not even if the power of the many, like a bogeyman, frightens us like children, sending us bonds and deaths and deprivation of property.	If we do not have better things to say at present, be assured that I will not grant you permission, nor even if there are more than those currently present, the power of the many terrifies us like children, sending forth bonds and deaths and confiscations of money.	If I do not speak better in the present, know that I will not allow it, nor will I, even if the power of the many, like a nursemaid to children, were to overwhelm us with more than what is present, send us bonds and deaths and confiscations of money.

By taking up first what you say about opinions and asking whether we were right when we always used to say that we ought to pay attention to some opinions and not to others ?	202	So how then shall we examine these things in the most moderate way? If first we should take up this argument, which you speak of concerning the opinions. Was it said well each time or not, that one must pay attention to some opinions but not to others?	How then would we consider these things most moderately? If we first took up this argument, which you make about opinions.

If first we take up this argument, which you are saying about the opinions. Was it well said each time or not, since some opinions indeed require the mind to pay attention, but others do not?

ἐλέγετο δέ πως , ὡς ἐγᾦμαι , ἑκάστοτε ὧδε ὑπὸ τῶν οἰομένων τὶ λέγειν , ὥσπερ νυνδὴ ἐγὼ ἔλεγον , ὅτι τῶν δοξῶν ἃς οἱ ἄνθρωποι δοξάζουσιν δέοι τὰς μὲν περὶ πολλοῦ ποιεῖσθαι , τὰς δὲ μή .	But it used to be said , I think , by those who thought they were speaking sensibly , just as I was saying now , that of the opinions held by men some ought to be highly esteemed and others not .	204	It was said somehow, as I think, always thus by those who thought they were saying something, just as I was saying now, that of the opinions which people hold, some should be valued highly, and others not.	It was said somehow, as I think, on each occasion in this way by those who thought they were saying something, just as I was just saying, that of the opinions which men hold, one should make much of some and not of others.	It is said, as I believe, that at all times this is the case by those who think they have something to say, just as now I was saying that concerning the beliefs which people hold, some ought to be valued highly, while others should not.	It was said, as I think, that each time they were here, the ones who thought they were saying something, just as I was saying now, that the things which people praise should be done for many, but not the ones that are not.
τοῦτο πρὸς θεῶν , ὦ Κρίτων , οὐ δοκεῖ καλῶς σοι λέγεσθαι ; —	In God ' s name , Crito , do you not think this is correct ?	205	By the gods, Crito, does this not seem to you to be said well?	Does this not seem to you, Crito, to be well said, by the gods?	This, in relation to the gods, O Criton, does it not seem to you to be spoken well?	Is this pleasing to the gods, O Crito?

Κρίτων . καλῶς .	Crito . It is .	207	Crito, good.	Crito, beautifully.	Crito. Well.	Socrates. Well.
Σωκράτης . οὐκοῦν τὰς μὲν χρηστὰς τιμᾶν , τὰς δὲ πονηρὰς μή ;	Socrates . Then we ought to esteem the good opinions and not the bad ones ?	208	Socrates: Therefore, should we honor the good things and not the bad things?	"Socrates: ""Then should we honor the good ones, but not the wicked ones?"""	Socrates. Therefore, should we honor the virtuous and not the wicked?	Socrates. Then do we honor the good and not the bad?
Κρίτων . ναί .	Crito . Yes .	209	Crito: Yes.	Crito. Yes.	Crito. Yes.	Socrates. Yes.
Σωκράτης . χρησταὶ δὲ οὐχ αἱ τῶν φρονίμων , πονηραὶ δὲ αἱ τῶν ἀφρόνων ;	Socrates . And the good ones are those of the wise and the bad ones those of the foolish ?	210	"""Socrates: But are not the actions of the wise good, and those of the foolish bad?"""	Socrates: And are not the good the wise, and the bad the foolish?	Socrates: Are not the good things of the wise, and the bad things of the foolish?	Socrates. Are not the virtuous the good, and the wicked the foolish?
Κρίτων . πῶς δ᾽ οὔ ;	Crito . Of course .	211	Crito. How could it not be?	Crito. How not?	Criton. Why not?	Socrates. How is it?
Σωκράτης . φέρε δή , πῶς αὖ τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐλέγετο ; γυμναζόμενος ἀνὴρ καὶ τοῦτο πράττων πότερον παντὸς ἀνδρὸς ἐπαίνῳ καὶ ψόγῳ καὶ δόξῃ τὸν νοῦν προσέχει , ἢ ἑνὸς μόνου ἐκείνου ὃς ἂν τυγχάνῃ ἰατρὸς ἢ παιδοτρίβης ὤν ;	Socrates . Come then , what used we to say about this ? If a man is an athlete and makes that his business , does he pay attention to every man ' s praise and blame and opinion or to those of one man only who is a physician or a trainer ?	212	Socrates: Tell me then, how were such things spoken of? A man who exercises and does this, does he pay attention to the praise and blame and opinion of all men, or of one only, namely the physician or the trainer?	Socrates: Come then, how were such things said? Does a man who is training and doing this pay attention to the praise and blame and opinion of every man, or only to that of one man who happens to be a doctor or a trainer?	Socrates: Come now, how were such things said again? Does a man who is being trained, in doing this, pay attention to the praise and blame and opinion of every man, or to that of a single one, whoever happens to be a physician or a trainer of boys?	Socrates. Come now, how was it said that such a man was being trained? A man who is being trained and is doing this, does he pay attention to the praise and blame and opinion of every man, or to that of one man only, who happens to be a doctor or a trainer?
Κρίτων . ἑνὸς μόνου .	Crito . To those of one man only .	213	Crito, of one thing only.	Crito. Of one thing only.	Crito. Of one alone.	Crito. Of one man.
Σωκράτης . οὐκοῦν φοβεῖσθαι χρὴ τοὺς ψόγους καὶ ἀσπάζεσθαι τοὺς ἐπαίνους τοὺς τοῦ ἑνὸς ἐκείνου ἀλλὰ μὴ τοὺς τῶν πολλῶν .	Socrates . Then he ought to fear the blame and welcome the praise of that one man and not of the multitude .	214	Socrates: Therefore, it is necessary to fear the criticisms and to welcome the praises of that one rather than those of the many.	Socrates: Must we not then fear the censures and welcome the praises of that one, but not those of the many?	Socrates: Therefore, one must fear the criticisms and embrace the praises of that one man, but not those of the many.	Socrates. So it is necessary to fear the censures and to welcome the praises of one, but not those of the many.
Κρίτων . δῆλα δή .	Crito . Obviously .	215	Crito, it is clear.	Crito: Clearly so.	Crito. Surely indeed.	Socrates. It is clear.
Σωκράτης . ταύτῃ ἄρα αὐτῷ πρακτέον καὶ γυμναστέον καὶ ἐδεστέον γε καὶ ποτέον , ᾗ ἂν τῷ ἑνὶ δοκῇ , τῷ ἐπιστάτῃ καὶ ἐπαΐοντι , μᾶλλον ἢ ᾗ σύμπασι τοῖς ἄλλοις .	Socrates . And he must act and exercise and eat and drink as the one man who is his director and who knows the business thinks best rather than as all the others think .	216	Socrates: Hence, one must act, exercise, eat, and drink in a manner that seems best to the one who is knowledgeable and skilled, rather than according to the opinion of the multitude.	Socrates: Then in this matter he must do and train and eat and drink in the way that seems good to the one, the ruler and the one who knows, rather than in the way that seems good to all the others.	Socrates: Therefore, he must be trained in this way and practiced, and also fed and drunk, as it seems best to the one who is in charge and knowledgeable, more so than to all the others.	Socrates. This, then, is what must be done and must be practiced and must be sought, as it seems best to the one who is in charge and who has understanding, rather than as it seems to all the others.
Κρίτων . ἔστι ταῦτα .	Crito . That is true .	217	Crito: These things are possible.	Crito. It is so.	Crito. These things exist.	Socrates. This is the case.
Σωκράτης . εἶεν . ἀπειθήσας δὲ τῷ ἑνὶ καὶ ἀτιμάσας αὐτοῦ τὴν δόξαν καὶ τοὺς ἐπαίνους , τιμήσας δὲ τοὺς τῶν πολλῶν λόγους καὶ μηδὲν ἐπαϊόντων , ἆρα οὐδὲν κακὸν πείσεται ; γ	Socrates . Well then ; if he disobeys the one man and disregards his opinion and his praise , but regards words of the many who have no special knowledge , will he not come to harm ?	218	Socrates: Well then, having disobeyed the one and dishonored his reputation and praises, but honored the words of the many who understand nothing, will he not suffer any harm?	Socrates: Come now, if he disobeys the one and disregards his opinion and praise, but honors the words of the many and those who know nothing, will he not suffer any harm?	Socrates. So, by disobeying the one and dishonoring his reputation and praises, but honoring the words of the many and being indifferent to them, will he suffer no evil?	Socrates. So be it. But if he disobeys one and dishonors his opinion and praise, and honors the opinions of the many and those who are not wise, will he not be persuaded to do something bad?
Κρίτων . πῶς γὰρ οὔ ;	Crito . Of course he will .	219	Crito: Why, of course!	Crito. How not?	Crito. Why not?	Socrates. How is it that?
Σωκράτης . τί δ᾽ ἔστι τὸ κακὸν τοῦτο , καὶ ποῖ τείνει , καὶ εἰς τί τῶν τοῦ ἀπειθοῦντος ;	Socrates . And what is this harm ? In what direction and upon what part of the one who disobeys does it act ?	220	Socrates: What is this evil, and where does it lead, and what results from the disobedient one?	Socrates: And what is this evil, and what is its end, and to what part of the disobedient does it direct itself?	Socrates: What is this evil, and where does it tend, and to what of the disobedient?	Socrates. What is this evil, and where does it extend, and to what in the one who is disobeying?
Κρίτων . δῆλον ὅτι εἰς τὸ σῶμα : τοῦτο γὰρ διόλλυσι .	Crito . Evidently upon his body ; for that is what it ruins .	221	Crito: It is clear that it is for the sake of the body, for this destroys it.	Crito. Clearly to the body: for that is what it destroys.	Crito: It is clear that it is into the body; for this destroys.	Crito. It is clear that it is to the body: for this is what is being destroyed.
Σωκράτης . καλῶς λέγεις . οὐκοῦν καὶ τἆλλα , ὦ Κρίτων , οὕτως , ἵνα μὴ πάντα διΐωμεν , καὶ δὴ καὶ περὶ τῶν δικαίων καὶ ἀδίκων καὶ αἰσχρῶν καὶ καλῶν καὶ ἀγαθῶν καὶ κακῶν , περὶ ὧν νῦν ἡ βουλὴ ἡμῖν ἐστιν , πότερον τῇ τῶν πολλῶν δόξῃ δεῖ ἡμᾶς ἕπεσθαι καὶ φοβεῖσθαι αὐτὴν ἢ τῇ τοῦ ἑνός , εἴ τίς ἐστιν ἐπαΐων , ὃν δεῖ καὶ αἰσχύνεσθαι καὶ φοβεῖσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ σύμπαντας τοὺς ἄλλους ; ᾧ εἰ μὴ ἀκολουθήσομεν , διαφθεροῦμεν ἐκεῖνο καὶ λωβησόμεθα , ὃ τῷ μὲν δικαίῳ βέλτιον ἐγίγνετο τῷ δὲ ἀδίκῳ ἀπώλλυτο . ἢ οὐδέν ἐστι τοῦτο ;	Socrates . Right . Then in other matters , not to enumerate them all , in questions of right and wrong and disgraceful and noble and good and bad , which we are now considering , ought we to follow and fear the opinion of the many or that of the one , if there is anyone who knows about them , whom we ought to revere and fear more than all the others ? And if we do not follow him , we shall injure and cripple that which we used to say is benefited by the right and is ruined by the wrong . Or is there nothing in this ?	222	Socrates: You speak well. So then, also with other things, O Crito, similarly, lest we go through everything, even concerning the just and the unjust, the shameful and the beautiful, the good and the bad, concerning which our discussion now is, whether we should follow and fear the opinion	Socrates: You speak well. Then are not these other things also so, Crito, that we should not care about the opinion of the many, but rather about the opinion of the one, if there is one who is wise, whom we should fear and be ashamed before more than all the others? For if	Socrates: You speak well. So, do we not consider all other matters, O Criton, in such a way that we do not fall into all things, and indeed also concerning the just and unjust and the shameful and beautiful and good and bad things, about which now the council is concerning us,	Socrates. Well said. Then, Kriton, let us do the same with the rest, so that we do not do everything, and indeed, about the just and unjust, the shameful and the beautiful, the good and the bad, about which our council is now, whether we should follow the opinion of
Κρίτων . οἶμαι ἔγωγε , ὦ Σώκρατες .	Crito . I think it is true , Socrates .	223	Crito: I indeed think so, Socrates.	Crito: I think so, Socrates.	Crito: I think, indeed, O Socrates.	Crito. I think so, Socrates.
Σωκράτης . φέρε δή , ἐὰν τὸ ὑπὸ τοῦ ὑγιεινοῦ μὲν βέλτιον γιγνόμενον , ὑπὸ τοῦ νοσώδους δὲ διαφθειρόμενον διολέσωμεν πειθόμενοι μὴ τῇ τῶν ἐπαϊόντων δόξῃ , ἆρα βιωτὸν ἡμῖν ἐστιν διεφθαρμένου αὐτοῦ ; ἔστι δέ που τοῦτο σῶμα : ἢ οὐχί ;	Socrates . Well then , if through yielding to the opinion of the ignorant we ruin that which is benefited by health and injured by disease , is life worth living for us when that is ruined ? And that is the body , is it not ?	224	Socrates: Come then, if we destroy that which becomes better by the healthy and is corrupted by the diseased, not following the opinion of the experts, is it possible for us to live when it is corrupted? This is the body, is it not?	Socrates: Come then, if we ruin that which is made better by the healthy and destroyed by the diseased, by following not the opinion of those who tend it, is life possible for us when it is ruined? And this is the body, is it not?	Socrates. Come now, if what is produced by the healthy is better, and what is destroyed by the diseased is perishing, should we be persuaded not by the opinion of the experts, is it then possible for us to live, being corrupt ourselves? But somewhere this body exists: or not?	Socrates. Come now, if we follow the opinion of the healthy and let the diseased perish, is it possible for us to live in a corrupted body? Is it not a body?
Κρίτων . ναί .	Crito . Yes .	225	Crito: Yes.	Crito. Yes.	Crito. Yes.	Socrates. Yes.
Σωκράτης . ἆρ᾽ οὖν βιωτὸν ἡμῖν ἐστιν μετὰ μοχθηροῦ καὶ διεφθαρμένου σώματος ;	Socrates . Then is life worth living when the body is worthless and ruined ?	226	"Socrates: ""Therefore, is it possible for us to live with a wicked and corrupted body?"""	Socrates: Is life worth living for us, then, with a wretched and corrupted body?	Socrates: Is it then possible for us to live with a wicked and corrupt body?	Socrates. Is life then a living for us with a wicked and corrupted body?
Κρίτων . οὐδαμῶς .	Crito . Certainly not .	227	Crito: Not at all.	Crito. Not at all.	Crito. Not at all.	Socrates. Not at all.
Σωκράτης . ἀλλὰ μετ᾽ ἐκείνου ἄρ᾽ ἡμῖν βιωτὸν διεφθαρμένου , ᾧ τὸ ἄδικον μὲν λωβᾶται , τὸ δὲ δίκαιον ὀνίνησιν ; ἢ φαυλότερον ἡγούμεθα εἶναι τοῦ σώματος ἐκεῖνο , ὅτι ποτ᾽ ἐστὶ τῶν ἡμετέρων , περὶ ὃ ἥ τε ἀδικία καὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη ἐστίν ;	Socrates . But is it worth living when that is ruined which is injured by the wrong and improved by the right ? Or do we think that part of us , whatever it is , which is concerned with right and wrong , is less important than the body ?	228	Socrates: But shall we live with that part of us corrupted, which dishonors injustice and honors justice? Or do we think that part of us is more contemptible than the body, whatever it may be, concerning which both injustice and justice are?	Socrates: But is life worth living for us with that part of us corrupted that injustice harms and justice profits? Or do we think that part of us, whatever it is, that is concerned with justice and injustice, is inferior to the body?	Socrates: But after him, is it indeed life for us that is corrupted, in which the unjust is harmed and the just is benefited? Or do we consider that body to be more base, since it is of our own, concerning which both injustice and justice are?	Socrates. But with him, then, is our life corrupted, in which the unjust is honored and the just is dishonored? Or do we think that the body is more contemptible than that of ours, in which both injustice and justice are?
Κρίτων . οὐδαμῶς .	Crito . By no means .	229	Crito: Not at all.	Crito. Not at all.	Crito. Not at all.	Socrates. Not at all.
Σωκράτης . ἀλλὰ τιμιώτερον ;	Socrates . But more important ?	230	Socrates: But what is more valuable?	Socrates: But more honourable?	Socrates. But what is more honorable?	Socrates. But what is more noble?
Κρίτων . πολύ γε .	Crito . Much more .	231	Crito: Very much so.	Crito: By all means.	Crito. Very much so.	Socrates. Very well.
Σωκράτης . οὐκ ἄρα , ὦ βέλτιστε , πάνυ ἡμῖν οὕτω φροντιστέον τί ἐροῦσιν οἱ πολλοὶ ἡμᾶς , ἀλλ᾽ ὅτι ὁ ἐπαΐων περὶ τῶν δικαίων καὶ ἀδίκων , ὁ εἷς καὶ αὐτὴ ἡ ἀλήθεια .	Socrates . Then , most excellent friend , we must not consider at all what the many will say of us , but what he who knows about right and wrong , the one man , and truth herself will say .	232	Socrates: So, my good man, we must not care so much about what the majority will say of us, but rather what the one who knows about just and unjust, the one and the truth itself, will say.	Socrates: Then, my good fellow, we must not be in the least concerned about what the many will say of us, but rather about what the expert on matters of justice and injustice, the one and the truth itself, will say.	Socrates: Surely, O best one, we should not be overly concerned about what the many will say about us, but about what the knowledgeable says regarding the just and the unjust, for it is he alone and the truth itself.	Socrates. Not at all, my best friend, we must pay no attention to what the many say, but rather that one who judges what is just and unjust is the truth itself.
ὥστε πρῶτον μὲν ταύτῃ οὐκ ὀρθῶς εἰσηγῇ , εἰσηγούμενος τῆς τῶν πολλῶν δόξης δεῖν ἡμᾶς φροντίζειν περὶ τῶν δικαίων καὶ καλῶν καὶ ἀγαθῶν καὶ τῶν ἐναντίων .	And so you introduced the discussion wrongly in the first place , when you began by saying we ought to consider the opinion of the multitude about the right and the noble and the good and their opposites .	233	Hence, first of all, in this manner, you are not proposing correctly, proposing that we must consider the opinion of the many regarding the just, the good, the noble, and their opposites.	So, in the first place, you do not introduce this correctly, introducing the opinion of the many that we ought to be concerned with just, fine, and good things and their opposites.	Therefore, first of all, you do not correctly argue this, suggesting that we must concern ourselves with things that are just, beautiful, and good, as well as their opposites.	So first of all, you are not correctly introducing this, introducing the glory of the many, that we should be concerned with the just and the beautiful and the good and the opposite.
ἔννοιά ποθ᾽ ἡμῖν ἐγένετο ὅσαι δημοκρατίαι κατελύθησαν ὑπὸ τῶν ἄλλως πως βουλομένων πολιτεύεσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ ἐν δημοκρατίᾳ , ὅσαι τ᾽ αὖ μοναρχίαι , ὅσαι τε ὀλιγαρχίαι ἀνῄρηνται ἤδη ὑπὸ δήμων , καὶ ὅσοι τυραννεῖν ἐπιχειρήσαντες οἱ μὲν αὐτῶν καὶ ταχὺ πάμπαν κατελύθησαν , οἱ δὲ κἂν ὁποσονοῦν χρόνον ἄρχοντες διαγένωνται , θαυμάζονται ὡς σοφοί τε καὶ εὐτυχεῖς ἄνδρες γεγενημένοι .	The thought once occurred to us how many republics have been overthrown by people who preferred to live under any form of government other than a republican , and again , how many monarchies and how many oligarchies in times past have been abolished by the people . We reflected , moreover , how many of those individuals who have aspired to absolute power have either been deposed once for all and that right quickly ; or if they have continued in power , no matter for how short a time , they are objects of wonder as having proved to be wise and happy men .	234	It once occurred to us how many democracies were overthrown by those who wished to govern otherwise than in a democracy, and how many monarchies and oligarchies have already been destroyed by the people, and how many of those who attempted to become tyrants were quickly overthrown altogether, while those who stayed	It has probably occurred to us that as many democracies as have been overthrown have been so by those who wished to be governed in some other way rather than in a democracy, and as many monarchies and oligarchies as have been abolished have been so by the people, and that those who have attempted to establish	There occurred to us a thought concerning all the democracies that have been destroyed by those wishing to rule in some other way rather than in democracy, and concerning all the monarchies that have been already removed by the peoples, and all those who attempted to be tyrants; some of them were quickly entirely overthrown,	It has become clear to us that all democracies that have been overthrown by those who wish to govern in some other way than in a democracy, and all monarchies, and all oligarchies that have been abolished by the people, and all who have attempted to tyrannize have either been completely overthrown at
πολλοὺς δ᾽ ἐδοκοῦμεν καταμεμαθηκέναι καὶ ἐν ἰδίοις οἴκοις τοὺς μὲν ἔχοντας καὶ πλείονας οἰκέτας , τοὺς δὲ καὶ πάνυ ὀλίγους , καὶ ὅμως οὐδὲ τοῖς ὀλίγοις τούτοις πάνυ τι δυναμένους χρῆσθαι πειθομένοις τοὺς δεσπότας .	Then , too , we had observed , we thought , that even in private homes some people who had rather more than the usual number of servants and some also who had only a very few were nevertheless , though nominally masters , quite unable to assert their authority over even those few .	235	And we seemed to have observed many, both in their own homes, some having even many servants and others very few, and yet not being able to manage these few servants to obey their masters.	We seemed to have observed many, both in their own homes, some having many slaves, others very few, and yet even with these few, their masters were not at all able to use them, being obedient.	We thought that many had learned to be trained at home, some having more servants, others having very few, and yet those few were not able at all to use them, persuading their masters.	We thought that many had learned and in their own homes, some had many servants, and many had few, and yet none of the few were able to use them as they pleased, being obedient to their masters.
ἔτι δὲ πρὸς τούτοις ἐνενοοῦμεν ὅτι ἄρχοντες μέν εἰσι καὶ οἱ βουκόλοι τῶν βοῶν καὶ οἱ ἱπποφορβοὶ τῶν ἵππων , καὶ πάντες δὲ οἱ καλούμενοι νομεῖς ὧν ἂν ἐπιστατῶσι ζῴων εἰκότως ἂν ἄρχοντες τούτων νομίζοιντο : πάσας τοίνυν ταύτας τὰς ἀγέλας ἐδοκοῦμεν ὁρᾶν μᾶλλον ἐθελούσας πείθεσθαι τοῖς νομεῦσιν ἢ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοῖς ἄρχουσι .	And in addition to this , we reflected that cowherds are the rulers of their cattle , that grooms are the rulers of their horses , and that all who are called herdsmen might properly be regarded as the rulers of the animals over which they are placed in charge . Now we noticed , as we thought , that all these herds obeyed their keepers more readily than men obey their rulers .	236	Moreover, we have been considering that the herdsmen of cattle and the horse breeders of horses are rulers, as well as all those who are called shepherds of animals they oversee might reasonably be considered rulers of these: we have been thinking that all these herds are more willing to obey their shepherds than people are	And besides this, we reflected that cowherds are rulers of cattle and horse-herders are rulers of horses, and all those called herdsmen might reasonably be considered rulers of the animals they oversee. Now we thought we saw all these herds more willingly obeying their herdsmen than men obeying their	Moreover, we also consider that the leaders are the herdsmen of the cattle and the horse keepers of the horses, and all those called herdsmen of whatever animals they oversee, would reasonably be regarded as their leaders: therefore, we thought that all these herds would willingly obey the herdsmen more than	Moreover, we also think that the shepherds of the cattle and the horse-herders of the horses are rulers, and all those called shepherds of whatever animals they oversee, it is reasonable to think that they are rulers of these. Therefore, we thought it more likely to see the flocks willing to
πορεύονταί τε γὰρ αἱ ἀγέλαι ᾗ ἂν αὐτὰς εὐθύνωσιν οἱ νομεῖς , νέμονταί τε χωρία ἐφ᾽ ὁποῖα ἂν αὐτὰς ἐπάγωσιν , ἀπέχονταί τε ὧν ἂν αὐτὰς ἀπείργωσι : καὶ τοῖς καρποῖς τοίνυν τοῖς γιγνομένοις ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐῶσι τοὺς νομέας χρῆσθαι οὕτως ὅπως ἂν αὐτοὶ βούλωνται .	For the herds go wherever their keeper directs them and graze in those places to which he leads them and keep out of those from which he excludes them . They allow their keeper , moreover , to enjoy , just as he will , the profits that accrue from them .	237	For the herds go wherever the herdsmen direct them, they graze the lands to which they are led, and they abstain from what they are kept away from; and so the herdsmen are allowed to use the fruits that come from them in whatever way they wish.	For the herds go wherever the herdsmen guide them, they graze in the places to which they are led, and they abstain from those from which they are kept away; and as for the produce that comes from them, they allow the herdsmen to use it as they wish.	For the herds move wherever the shepherds guide them, and they graze in whichever pastures they are led, and they refrain from whatever they are kept away from; and thus the shepherds are allowed to use the fruits that arise from them as they themselves wish.	For the flocks are driven by the shepherds wherever they may lead them, and they are pastured in the fields to which they may be led, and they are kept away from those from which they may be driven off: and thus the shepherds are allowed to use the fruits of them as they please
ἔτι τοίνυν οὐδεμίαν πώποτε ἀγέλην ᾐσθήμεθα συστᾶσαν ἐπὶ τὸν νομέα οὔτε ὡς μὴ πείθεσθαι οὔτε ὡς μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν τῷ καρπῷ χρῆσθαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ χαλεπώτεραί εἰσιν αἱ ἀγέλαι πᾶσι τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις ἢ τοῖς ἄρχουσί τε καὶ ὠφελουμένοις ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν : ἄνθρωποι δὲ ἐπ᾽ οὐδένας μᾶλλον συνίστανται ἢ ἐπὶ τούτους οὓς ἂν αἴσθωνται ἄρχειν αὑτῶν ἐπιχειροῦντας .	And then again , we have never known of a herd conspiring against its keeper , either to refuse obedience to him or to deny him the privilege of enjoying the profits that accrue . At the same time , herds are more intractable to strangers than to their rulers and those who derive profit from them . Men , however , conspire against none sooner than against those whom they see attempting to rule over them .	238	Moreover, we have never yet seen a herd band together against the herdsman, either to disobey or to prevent him from using the fruit, but the herds are more troublesome to all strangers than to those who rule and benefit from them; but people band together against none more than those whom they perceive are	We have never yet noticed a herd uniting against its feeder, either to refuse obedience or to deny him the right to use its produce, but herds are more troublesome to strangers than to their owners and those who derive profit from them. Men, however, unite against none more than against those whom they perceive attempting to	Yet, we have never perceived a herd gathering to the herdsman, either to disobey or to refrain from using the fruit, but rather the herds are more troublesome to all the strangers than to those both in authority and benefiting from them: but men are more united against those they perceive to be attempting to	We have never yet seen a flock that has been gathered together for the purpose of not obeying or not allowing the fruit to be used, but the flocks of all the foreigners are more difficult than those of the rulers and those who benefit from them. But men are gathered together against no one more than against those whom
ὅτε μὲν δὴ ταῦτα ἐνεθυμούμεθα , οὕτως ἐγιγνώσκομεν περὶ αὐτῶν , ὡς ἀνθρώπῳ πεφυκότι πάντων τῶν ἄλλων ῥᾷον εἴη ζῴων ἢ ἀνθρώπων ἄρχειν .	Thus , as we meditated on this analogy , we were inclined to conclude that for man , as he is constituted , it is easier to rule over any and all other creatures than to rule over men .	239	"""When, indeed, we thought about these things, we decided about them thus, that for a man it would be easier than for all other living beings to rule men."""	When we reflected on these things, we realized that, being human, it was naturally easier for him to rule all other creatures than to rule humans.	When indeed we ponder these things, we understand concerning them in such a way that it is easier for a man by nature to rule over all other animals than over other men.	When we are thinking these things, we judge them to be as if they were a man born to rule over all other men rather than animals.
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἐνενοήσαμεν ὅτι Κῦρος ἐγένετο Πέρσης , ὃς παμπόλλους μὲν ἀνθρώπους ἐκτήσατο πειθομένους αὑτῷ , παμπόλλας δὲ πόλεις , πάμπολλα δὲ ἔθνη , ἐκ τούτου δὴ ἠναγκαζόμεθα μετανοεῖν μὴ οὔτε τῶν ἀδυνάτων οὔτε τῶν χαλεπῶν ἔργων ᾖ τὸ ἀνθρώπων ἄρχειν , ἤν τις ἐπισταμένως τοῦτο πράττῃ .	But when we reflected that there was one Cyrus , the Persian , who reduced to obedience a vast number of men and cities and nations , we were then compelled to change our opinion and decide that to rule men might be a task neither impossible nor even difficult , if one should only go about it in an intelligent manner .	240	Since we realized that Cyrus became a Persian, who acquired very many people obedient to him, very many cities, and very many nations, from this we were compelled to change our minds that ruling over people is neither an impossible nor a difficult task, if one manages it skillfully.	But when we reflected that Cyrus was a Persian, who had acquired very many men who obeyed him, and very many cities, and very many nations, from that point we were compelled to change our mind, that ruling men is not an impossible or even a difficult task, if one goes about it with knowledge.	When we realized that Cyrus became a Persian, who indeed acquired very many people persuaded to him, as well as very many cities and very many nations, from this we are compelled to reconsider that neither the impossible nor the difficult works could be for men to rule, if anyone is competent to do this.	Since we have come to understand that Cyrus became a Persian, who has won over many men who obey him, many cities, and many nations, we are therefore forced to change our minds and not think that ruling over men is impossible or difficult, if anyone does it wisely.
Κύρῳ γοῦν ἴσμεν ἐθελήσαντας πείθεσθαι τοὺς μὲν ἀπέχοντας παμπόλλων ἡμερῶν ὁδόν , τοὺς δὲ καὶ μηνῶν , τοὺς δὲ οὐδ᾽ ἑωρακότας πώποτ᾽ αὐτόν , τοὺς δὲ καὶ εὖ εἰδότας ὅτι οὐδ᾽ ἂν ἴδοιεν , καὶ ὅμως ἤθελον αὐτῷ ὑπακούειν .	At all events , we know that people obeyed Cyrus willingly , although some of them were distant from him a journey of many days , and others of many months ; others , although they had never seen him , and still others who knew well that they never should see him . Nevertheless they were all willing to be his subjects .	241	We know that some people obeyed Cyrus willingly although they were many days’ journey away, some even months away, some had never even seen him, and some knew very well that they would never see him, yet they still wanted to obey him.	At any rate, we know that people were willing to obey Cyrus, some of whom lived many days' journey away, some even months' journey, some who had never seen him, and some who knew well that they would never see him; and yet they were willing to obey him.	Indeed, we know that Cyrus wanted to persuade those who were far removed from the way for many days, those for months, those who had never even seen him, and those who knew well that they would not ever see him, and yet they wanted to obey him.	We know that those who were willing to obey were those who were far away on a long road, those who were far away in months, those who had never seen him, and those who knew that they would never see him, and yet they wanted to obey him.
καὶ τοίνυν τούτων τῶν ἐθνῶν ἦρξεν οὔτε αὐτῷ ὁμογλώττων ὄντων οὔτε ἀλλήλοις , καὶ ὅμως ἐδυνάσθη ἐφικέσθαι μὲν ἐπὶ τοσαύτην γῆν τῷ ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ φόβῳ , ὥστε καταπλῆξαι πάντας καὶ μηδένα ἐπιχειρεῖν αὐτῷ , ἐδυνάσθη δὲ ἐπιθυμίαν ἐμβαλεῖν τοσαύτην τοῦ πάντας αὐτῷ χαρίζεσθαι ὥστε ἀεὶ τῇ αὐτοῦ γνώμῃ ἀξιοῦν κυβερνᾶσθαι , ἀνηρτήσατο δὲ τοσαῦτα φῦλα ὅσα καὶ διελθεῖν ἔργον ἐστίν , ὅποι ἂν ἄρξηταί τις πορεύεσθαι ἀπὸ τῶν βασιλείων , ἤν τε πρὸς ἕω ἤν τε πρὸς ἑσπέραν ἤν τε πρὸς ἄρκτον ἤν τε πρὸς μεσημβρίαν .	He ruled over these nations , even though they did not speak the same language as he , nor one nation the same as another ; for all that , he was able to cover so vast a region with the fear which he inspired , that he struck all men with terror and no one tried to withstand him ; and he was able to awaken in all so lively a desire to please him , that they always wished to be guided by his will . Moreover , the tribes that he brought into subjection to himself were so many that it is a difficult matter even to travel to them all , in whatever direction one begin one ' s journey from the palace , whether toward the east or the west , toward the north or the south .	242	And so he ruled over these nations, which neither spoke his language nor each other's, and yet he was able to reach such a vast land through the fear he inspired, so as to amaze everyone and for nobody to dare oppose him; and he managed to instill such a desire for everyone to please him that they always	And yet he was the ruler of these nations, neither speaking the same language as him nor as each other, and yet he was able to inspire such fear of himself that he struck awe in all and no one dared to oppose him, and he was able to instill such a great desire to please him that they always	And thus he began to rule over these nations, neither with those of the same tongue nor with each other, and yet he was able to reach such a land through his own fear, so as to terrify all and no one dared to attempt against him; but he was able to instill such a desire that all	And so, although he was not of the same tongue as these nations, nor did they understand one another, yet he was able to conquer so much land by his own fear, that he struck fear into all and no one dared to oppose him. And he was able to inspire such a desire in all that they would

Believing this man to be deserving of all admiration , we have therefore investigated who he was in his origin , what natural endowments he possessed , and what sort of education he had enjoyed , that he so greatly excelled in governing men .	243	We indeed considered this man, being worthy of admiration, examining who he might be in ancestry and what sort of nature he possesses and with what kind of education he was educated, to have excelled so greatly in leading people.	We, then, have thought this man worthy of admiration and have examined who he was by birth, what kind of nature he had, and with what kind of education he was educated, that he so far excelled in ruling men.	We indeed have considered this man as worthy to be wondered at, examining what he is in origin and what sort of nature he possesses, and by what kind of education he was nurtured to such an extent that he arrived at the leadership of men.	We have therefore thought it worthy of wonder to consider this man, who, being of what family and of what nature, and having been educated in what kind of education, has come to be ruler of men.
ὅσα οὖν καὶ ἐπυθόμεθα καὶ ᾐσθῆσθαι δοκοῦμεν περὶ αὐτοῦ , ταῦτα πειρασόμεθα διηγήσασθαι .	Accordingly , what we have found out or think we know concerning him we shall now endeavour to present .	244	So, as much as we have learned and seem to perceive about it, we shall attempt to relate these things.

Therefore, all that we have learned and seem to have perceived about him, we shall attempt to narrate.

And even to this day the barbarians tell in story and in song that Cyrus was most handsome in person , most generous of heart , most devoted to learning , and most ambitious , so that he endured all sorts of labour and faced all sorts of danger for the sake of praise .	246	Cyrus is said to have been born and is still sung about by the barbarians as having the most beautiful form, the most philanthropic soul, the most eager to learn, and the most ambitious, so as to endure every toil and face every danger for the sake of being praised.

διὰ τοῦτο δὲ δημοσίᾳ τοῦ θηρᾶν ἐπιμέλονται , καὶ βασιλεὺς ὥσπερ καὶ ἐν πολέμῳ ἡγεμών ἐστιν αὐτοῖς καὶ αὐτός τε θηρᾷ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἐπιμελεῖται ὅπως ἂν θηρῶσιν , ὅτι ἀληθεστάτη αὐτοῖς δοκεῖ εἶναι αὕτη ἡ μελέτη τῶν πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον .	They provide for such hunting out of the public treasury ; and as the king is their leader in war , so he not only takes part in the hunt himself but sees to it that the others hunt , too . The state bears the expense of the hunting for the reason that the training it gives seems to be the best preparation for war itself .	247	For this reason, they take care publicly of hunting, and the king is both their leader, as in war, and he himself hunts and takes care that the others hunt, because this practice seems to them the truest preparation for war.	For this reason they publicly take care of hunting, and the king is their leader in it just as in war, and he himself hunts and takes care that the others hunt, because this pursuit seems to them to be the most genuine preparation for war.	For this reason, they take care of hunting publicly, and the king is a leader for them just as in war, and he himself hunts and takes care of the others so that they may hunt, because this is believed to be the most truthful preparation for war.	Therefore, they take care of the wild beasts publicly, and the king is their leader, just as in war, and he himself hunts and takes care that the others hunt, because he thinks that this is the most true care for war.
καὶ γὰρ πρῲ ἀνίστασθαι ἐθίζει καὶ ψύχη καὶ θάλπη ἀνέχεσθαι , γυμνάζει δὲ καὶ ὁδοιπορίαις καὶ δρόμοις , ἀνάγκη δὲ καὶ τοξεῦσαι θηρίον καὶ ἀκοντίσαι ὅπου ἂν παραπίπτῃ .	For it accustoms them to rise early in the morning and to endure both heat and cold , and it gives them practice in taking long tramps and runs , and they have to shoot or spear a wild beast whenever it comes in their way .	248	"""For it accustoms one to rise early in the morning, to endure both cold and heat; it trains one through journeys and runs; it is necessary to shoot at a beast and to hurl a javelin wherever it might appear."""	For it also accustoms him to rise early and endure cold and heat, and it trains him in marching and running, and he must also shoot a wild beast with a bow and throw a javelin wherever it falls.	And indeed, it accustomed both the soul and the body to rise early, and it trains in journeys and running; necessity also compels one to hunt wild beasts and to throw a spear wherever it may fall.	For it also accustoms the soul to endure hardships and to bear cold, and it trains by journeys and runs, and it is necessary to hunt a beast and to throw a javelin wherever it may fall.
καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν δὲ πολλάκις ἀνάγκη θήγεσθαι ὅταν τι τῶν ἀλκίμων θηρίων ἀνθιστῆται : παίειν μὲν γὰρ δήπου δεῖ τὸ ὁμόσε γιγνόμενον , φυλάξασθαι δὲ τὸ ἐπιφερόμενον : ὥστε οὐ ῥᾴδιον εὑρεῖν τί ἐν τῇ θήρᾳ ἄπεστι τῶν ἐν πολέμῳ παρόντων .	And they must often whet their courage when one of the fierce beasts shows fight ; for , of course , they must strike down the animal that comes to close quarters with them , and they must be on their guard against the one that threatens to attack them . In a word , it is not easy to find any quality required in war that is not required also in the chase .	249	And the soul, too, often needs to be sharpened whenever any of the valiant beasts resist: for surely one must both strike at whatever approaches closely and guard against whatever is being brought [forward]: so that it is not easy to find what is lacking in the hunt of things present in war.	And it is often necessary to risk one's life when one of the powerful beasts opposes: for one must strike what comes within range and guard against what is attacking, so that it is not easy to find what is absent in hunting from what is present in war.	And the soul must often be trained when any of the strong beasts stands against it: for indeed it is necessary to strike what comes close, but to guard against what attacks: so it is not easy to find what is absent in the beast of those present in war.	And the soul must often be led when some of the fierce beasts are stirred up: for it is necessary to fight the one that is formed together, and to guard against the one that is coming: so that it is not easy to find out what is missing in the beast, of those that are present in war.

Such then were the natural endowments , physical and spiritual , that he is reputed to have had ; but he was educated in conformity with the laws of the Persians ; and these laws appear in their care for the common weal not to start from the same point as they do in most states .	250	The nature of his form and soul being such is remembered: he was indeed educated in the laws of the Persians: and these laws seem to begin by taking care of the common good, not as they do in most cities.	He is remembered as having a nature of form and soul of this kind: he was educated in the laws of the Persians; these laws seem to begin by taking care of the common good, not from where most cities begin.	Indeed, having such a nature of form and soul, he is remembered: he was educated, however, in the laws of the Persians: these laws seem to govern the common good, taking care not from where the most cities are governed.	He is remembered for his physical and mental qualities: he was educated in the laws of the Persians: and these laws are thought to be concerned with the common good, and are the starting point for the laws of most cities.

They have their so-called "" Free Square , "" where the royal palace and other government buildings are located ."	252	But the Persian laws, having anticipated, take care that the citizens would not become ones inclined to any wicked or shameful act. And they take care as follows: they have a place called a free market, where the royal courts and other such offices have been established.	The Persian laws, taking precautions beforehand, care that the citizens shall not be of such a character as to desire anything improper or base. They take care in the following way: there is a so-called free agora among them, where the royal and other noble buildings have been constructed.

From here the wares and the market people and the shouts and ignorance of these have been banished to another place, so that their tumult may not mix with the good order of the educated.	From here the goods and the market people and their voices and endless chatter have been driven away to another place, so that the tumult of these may not be mingled with the decorum of the educated.

οἱ μὲν δὴ παῖδες εἰς τὰ διδασκαλεῖα φοιτῶντες διάγουσι μανθάνοντες δικαιοσύνην : καὶ λέγουσιν ὅτι ἐπὶ τοῦτο ἔρχονται ὥσπερ παρ᾽ ἡμῖν ὅτι γράμματα μαθησόμενοι .	The boys go to school and spend their time in learning justice ; and they say that they go there for this purpose , just as in our country they say that they go to learn to read and write .	260	The children, attending school, spend their time learning justice; and they say that they go for this just as among us they say they are going to learn letters.

The boys, indeed, going to the schools, run about learning justice: and they say that they come for this purpose, just as with us, to learn letters.
οἱ δ᾽ ἄρχοντες αὐτῶν διατελοῦσι τὸ πλεῖστον τῆς ἡμέρας δικάζοντες αὐτοῖς .	And their officers spend the greater part of the day in deciding cases for them .	261	Their leaders spend most of the day judging for them.	And their rulers spend most of the day judging them.	But the rulers of them spend most of the day judging them.	But the rulers of them spend most of the day judging for them.
γίγνεται γὰρ δὴ καὶ παισὶ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ὥσπερ ἀνδράσιν ἐγκλήματα καὶ κλοπῆς καὶ ἁρπαγῆς καὶ βίας καὶ ἀπάτης καὶ κακολογίας καὶ ἄλλων οἵων δὴ εἰκός . οὓς δ᾽ ἂν γνῶσι τούτων τι ἀδικοῦντας , τιμωροῦνται .	For , as a matter of course , boys also prefer charges against one another , just as men do , of theft , robbery , assault , cheating , slander , and other things that naturally come up ; and when they discover any one committing any of these crimes , they punish him ,	262	For indeed, there are also among children mutual accusations just as among men, of theft and robbery and violence and deceit and slander and other such things. And whenever they recognize any of these wrongdoings, they punish them.	For indeed even among children in relation to one another there occur, just as among men, accusations and thefts and seizures and violence and deceit and slander and other such things as are likely. And those whom they know to be doing any of these unjust things, they punish.	For indeed, there arise among children against one another, just as among men, crimes of theft, robbery, violence, deceit, slander, and other such things as are likely. Those whom they know to be wronging others are punished.	For children also commit crimes against one another, just as men do, of theft, robbery, violence, deceit, slander, and other things of which it is likely. And those who know of them being guilty are punished.
κολάζουσι δὲ καὶ ὃν ἂν ἀδίκως ἐγκαλοῦντα εὑρίσκωσι .	and they punish also any one whom they find accusing another falsely .	263	They also punish anyone whom they find accusing unjustly.	They also punish anyone whom they find bringing an unjust accusation.	They punish also whomever they find bringing false accusations.	They also punish whoever they find accusing unjustly.
δικάζουσι δὲ καὶ ἐγκλήματος οὗ ἕνεκα ἄνθρωποι μισοῦσι μὲν ἀλλήλους μάλιστα , δικάζονται δὲ ἥκιστα , ἀχαριστίας , καὶ ὃν ἂν γνῶσι δυνάμενον μὲν χάριν ἀποδιδόναι , μὴ ἀποδιδόντα δέ , κολάζουσι καὶ τοῦτον ἰσχυρῶς .	And they bring one another to trial also charged with an offence for which people hate one another most but go to law least , namely , that of ingratitude ; and if they know that any one is able to return a favour and fails to do so , they punish him also severely .	264	And they judge even for an accusation on account of which people especially hate each other, but for which they are least judged, for ingratitude, and him whom they find capable of returning a favor, yet not returning it, they also punish this one severely.	They also try cases of offenses which men commit against each other most frequently but settle least often, namely, ingratitude; and if they find someone able to return a favor but failing to do so, they punish him heavily.	They judge also for the crime of which because men especially hate one another, but they are judged least of all, for ingratitude, and whoever they know can give a favor, but does not give it, they punish him strongly.

οἴονται γὰρ τοὺς ἀχαρίστους καὶ περὶ θεοὺς ἂν μάλιστα ἀμελῶς ἔχειν καὶ περὶ γονέας καὶ πατρίδα καὶ φίλους . ἕπεσθαι δὲ δοκεῖ μάλιστα τῇ ἀχαριστίᾳ ἡ ἀναισχυντία : καὶ γὰρ αὕτη μεγίστη δοκεῖ εἶναι ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ αἰσχρὰ ἡγεμών .	For they think that the ungrateful are likely to be most neglectful of their duty toward their gods , their parents , their country , and their friends ; for it seems that shamelessness goes hand in hand with ingratitude ; and it is that , we know , which leads the way to every moral wrong .	265	For they think that the ungrateful would be especially careless both in respect to the gods and in respect to parents and fatherland and friends. Shamelessness seems to follow ingratitude especially, for it also seems to be the greatest leader towards all shameless acts.	For they think that the ungrateful would be most neglectful also about the gods and about parents and country and friends. And shamelessness seems to follow ingratitude most closely; for it is also considered the greatest guide to all shameful things.

διδάσκουσι δὲ τοὺς παῖδας καὶ σωφροσύνην : μέγα δὲ συμβάλλεται εἰς τὸ μανθάνειν σωφρονεῖν αὐτοὺς ὅτι καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ὁρῶσιν ἀνὰ πᾶσαν ἡμέραν σωφρόνως διάγοντας .	They teach the boys self-control also ; and it greatly conduces to their learning self-control that they see their elders also living temperately day by day .	266	And they teach the children also self-control: and it greatly contributes to their learning self-control that they see the elders spending every day with self-control.

διδάσκουσι δὲ καὶ ἐγκράτειαν γαστρὸς καὶ ποτοῦ : μέγα δὲ καὶ εἰς τοῦτο συμβάλλεται ὅτι ὁρῶσι τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους οὐ πρόσθεν ἀπιόντας γαστρὸς ἕνεκα πρὶν ἂν ἀφῶσιν οἱ ἄρχοντες , καὶ ὅτι οὐ παρὰ μητρὶ σιτοῦνται οἱ παῖδες , ἀλλὰ παρὰ τῷ διδασκάλῳ , ὅταν οἱ ἄρχοντες σημήνωσι .	And besides , they teach them self-restraint in eating and drinking ; and it greatly conduces to this also that they see that their elders do not leave their post to satisfy their hunger until the officers dismiss them ; and the same end is promoted by the fact that the boys do not eat with their mothers but with their teachers , from the time the officers so direct .	268	They also teach self-control of the stomach and drink; and it contributes greatly to this that they see the elders not leaving on account of the stomach before the magistrates dismiss them, and that the children do not take their meals with their mothers, but with the teacher when the magistrates give the sign.	They also teach them to control their appetites for food and drink, and one of the most important means of achieving this is that they see their elders waiting until the rulers give the signal before leaving to eat, and that the boys do not eat with their mothers, but with their teacher, when the rulers give the signal	They teach both self-control of the belly and drinking: and it is significant that they see the elders not departing for the sake of the belly before the rulers have let them go, and that the children do not ask for food from their mother, but from the teacher, when the rulers signal.

And a great thing is that they see the elders not going out before they have been dismissed by the rulers, and that the children are not fed by their mothers, but by the teacher, when the rulers signal.

μέχρι μὲν δὴ ἓξ ἢ ἑπτακαίδεκα ἐτῶν ἀπὸ γενεᾶς οἱ παῖδες ταῦτα πράττουσιν , ἐκ τούτου δὲ εἰς τοὺς ἐφήβους ἐξέρχονται .	This , then , is what the boys do until they are sixteen or seventeen years of age , and after this they are promoted from the class of boys and enrolled among the young men .	271	"""Up until they are sixteen or seventeen years old from birth, the children do these things; after this, they go out into the ephebes."""

Now the young men in their turn live as follows : for ten years after they are promoted from the class of boys they pass the nights , as we said before , about the government buildings . This they do for the sake of guarding the city and of developing their powers of self-control ; for this time of life , it seems , demands the most watchful care . And during the day , too , they put themselves at the disposal of the authorities , if they are needed for any service to the state .	272	These young men, however, live as follows: for ten years after they leave childhood they sleep around the public offices, as we have mentioned, both to guard the city and for discipline; for this age seems to need the most care; they also make themselves available during the day to the officials if they are needed for	And these youths spend their time in the following way: for ten years after they have come out of the class of boys, they sleep around the public buildings, as we said before, both for the sake of guarding the city and for the sake of sobriety; for it seems that this age is most in need	These youths, however, spend their time in this way.
