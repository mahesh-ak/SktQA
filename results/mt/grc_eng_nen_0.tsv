ὤ μοι ἀναιδείην ἐπιειμένε κερδαλεόφρον πῶς τίς τοι πρόφρων ἔπεσιν πείθηται Ἀχαιῶν ἢ ὁδὸν ἐλθέμεναι ἢ ἀνδράσιν ἶφι μάχεσθαι ;	Ah me , clothed in shamelessness , thinking of profit , how shall any man of the Achaeans obey your words with a ready heart either to go on a journey or to fight against men with force ?	76	Alas, you are clothed in shamelessness and cunning, how will any of the Achaeans willingly obey your words, either to go on a journey or to fight men valiantly?
οὐ γὰρ ἐγὼ Τρώων ἕνεκ᾽ ἤλυθον αἰχμητάων δεῦρο μαχησόμενος , ἐπεὶ οὔ τί μοι αἴτιοί εἰσιν :	It was not on account of the Trojan spearmen that I came here to fight , since they have done no wrong to me .	77	For it was not on account of the Trojan spearmen that I came here to fight, since they are in no way to blame as far as I am concerned.
οὐ γὰρ πώποτ᾽ ἐμὰς βοῦς ἤλασαν οὐ δὲ μὲν ἵππους , οὐ δέ ποτ᾽ ἐν Φθίῃ ἐριβώλακι βωτιανείρῃ καρπὸν ἐδηλήσαντ᾽ , ἐπεὶ ἦ μάλα πολλὰ μεταξὺ οὔρεά τε σκιόεντα θάλασσά τε ἠχήεσσα :	Never have they driven off my cattle or my horses , nor ever in deep-soiled Phthia , nurse of men , did they lay waste the harvest , for many things lie between us — shadowy mountains and sounding sea .	78	For never yet have they driven my cattle or my horses, nor ever in deep-soiled Phthia, nurse of men, did they lay waste the harvest, since indeed there are many shadowy mountains and the resounding sea between.
ἀλλὰ σοὶ ὦ μέγ᾽ ἀναιδὲς ἅμ᾽ ἑσπόμεθ᾽ ὄφρα σὺ χαίρῃς , τιμὴν ἀρνύμενοι Μενελάῳ σοί τε κυνῶπα πρὸς Τρώων :	But you , shameless one , we followed , so that you might rejoice , seeking to win recompense for Menelaus and for yourself , dog-face , from the Trojans .	79	But for you, great shameless one, we followed to make you happy, winning honor for Menelaus and for you, dogface, from the Trojans.

ἀτὰρ ἤν ποτε δασμὸς ἵκηται , σοὶ τὸ γέρας πολὺ μεῖζον , ἐγὼ δ᾽ ὀλίγον τε φίλον τε ἔρχομ᾽ ἔχων ἐπὶ νῆας , ἐπεί κε κάμω πολεμίζων .	but if ever an apportionment comes , your prize is far greater , while small but dear is the reward I take to my ships , when I have worn myself out in the fighting .	84	"""But whenever a division of spoil comes, your prize is much greater, while I come to the ships with a small and dear one, when I have exhausted myself in fighting."""
νῦν δ᾽ εἶμι Φθίην δ᾽ , ἐπεὶ ἦ πολὺ φέρτερόν ἐστιν οἴκαδ᾽ ἴμεν σὺν νηυσὶ κορωνίσιν , οὐ δέ σ᾽ ὀΐω ἐνθάδ᾽ ἄτιμος ἐὼν ἄφενος καὶ πλοῦτον ἀφύξειν .	Now I will go back to Phthia , since it is far better to return home with my beaked ships , nor do I intend while I am here dishonoured to pile up riches and wealth for you .	85	But now I will go to Phthia, since it is much better to go home with the curved ships, and I do not think that here, dishonored as I am, I will amass wealth and riches.

ὡς ἔγωγε καὶ ὑπὲρ σοῦ καὶ ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν τῶν σῶν ἐπιτηδείων αἰσχύνομαι μὴ δόξῃ ἅπαν τὸ πρᾶγμα τὸ περὶ σὲ ἀνανδρίᾳ τινὶ τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ πεπρᾶχθαι , καὶ ἡ εἴσοδος τῆς δίκης εἰς τὸ δικαστήριον ὡς εἰσῆλθεν ἐξὸν μὴ εἰσελθεῖν , καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ ἀγὼν τῆς δίκης ὡς ἐγένετο , καὶ τὸ τελευταῖον δὴ τουτί , ὥσπερ κατάγελως τῆς πράξεως , κακίᾳ τινὶ καὶ ἀνανδρίᾳ τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ διαπεφευγέναι ἡμᾶς δοκεῖν , οἵτινές σε οὐχὶ ἐσώσαμεν οὐδὲ σὺ σαυτόν , οἷόν τε ὂν καὶ δυνατὸν εἴ τι καὶ μικρὸν ἡμῶν ὄφελος ἦν .	So I am shamed both for you and for us , your friends , and I am afraid people will think that this whole affair of yours has been conducted with a sort of cowardice on our part — both the fact that the case came before the court , when it might have been avoided , and the way in which the trial itself was carried on , and finally they will think , as the crowning absurdity of the whole affair , that this opportunity has escaped us through some base cowardice on our part , since we did not save you , and you did not save yourself , though it was quite possible if we had been of any use whatever .	149	For I, at least, am ashamed on your behalf and on behalf of us, your friends, that the whole matter concerning you might seem to have been done because of some cowardice of ours, and that the trial was brought into the court when it could have not been, and that the whole conduct of the trial
ταῦτα οὖν , ὦ Σώκρατες , ὅρα μὴ ἅμα τῷ κακῷ καὶ αἰσχρὰ ᾖ σοί τε καὶ ἡμῖν .	Take care , Socrates , that these things be not disgraceful , as well as evil , both to you and to us .	150	Therefore, Socrates, see that these things do not bring shame and harm both to you and to us.

Just consider , or rather it is time not to consider any longer , but to have finished considering . And there is just one possible plan ; for all this must be done in the coming night .

He is used to me by this time , Socrates , because I come here so often , and besides I have done something for him .	158	Crito: It is already familiar to me, Socrates, because of my frequent visits here, and he has also been somewhat benefited by me.
Σωκράτης . ἄρτι δὲ ἥκεις ἢ πάλαι ;	Socrates . Have you just come , or some time ago ?	159	Socrates: Have you just arrived or have you been here for a while?
Κρίτων . ἐπιεικῶς πάλαι .	Crito . Some little time ago .	160	Crito: Quite some time.
Σωκράτης . εἶτα πῶς οὐκ εὐθὺς ἐπήγειράς με , ἀλλὰ σιγῇ παρακάθησαι ; γ	Socrates . Then why did you not wake me at once , instead of sitting by me in silence ?	161	Socrates: Then why did you not wake me up at once, but sat beside me in silence?
Κρίτων . οὐ μὰ τὸν Δία , ὦ Σώκρατες , οὐδ᾽ ἂν αὐτὸς ἤθελον ἐν τοσαύτῃ τε ἀγρυπνίᾳ καὶ λύπῃ εἶναι , ἀλλὰ καὶ σοῦ πάλαι θαυμάζω αἰσθανόμενος ὡς ἡδέως καθεύδεις : καὶ ἐπίτηδές σε οὐκ ἤγειρον ἵνα ὡς ἥδιστα διάγῃς .	Crito . No , no , by Zeus , Socrates , I only wish I myself were not so sleepless and sorrowful . But I have been wondering at you for some time , seeing how sweetly you sleep ; and I purposely refrained from waking you , that you might pass the time as pleasantly as possible .	162	Crito: By Zeus, Socrates, I myself would not want to be in such a state of sleeplessness and sorrow, but I have been wondering for a while at how pleasantly you sleep: and I intentionally did not wake you up so that you might have as pleasant a stay as possible.
καὶ πολλάκις μὲν δή σε καὶ πρότερον ἐν παντὶ τῷ βίῳ ηὐδαιμόνισα τοῦ τρόπου , πολὺ δὲ μάλιστα ἐν τῇ νῦν παρεστώσῃ συμφορᾷ , ὡς ῥᾳδίως αὐτὴν καὶ πρᾴως φέρεις .	I have often thought throughout your life hitherto that you were of a happy disposition , and I think so more than ever in this resent misfortune , since you bear it so easily and calmly .	163	"""And many times indeed, even before, in all your life I have considered you fortunate for your character, but especially now in the present misfortune, for how easily and gently you endure it."""
Σωκράτης . καὶ γὰρ ἄν , ὦ Κρίτων , πλημμελὲς εἴη ἀγανακτεῖν τηλικοῦτον ὄντα εἰ δεῖ ἤδη τελευτᾶν .	Socrates . Well , Crito , it would be absurd if at my age I were disturbed because I must die now .	164	Socrates: It would indeed be unreasonable, Crito, for someone of my age to be upset if it is time to die.
Κρίτων . καὶ ἄλλοι , ὦ Σώκρατες , τηλικοῦτοι ἐν τοιαύταις συμφοραῖς ἁλίσκονται , ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲν αὐτοὺς ἐπιλύεται ἡ ἡλικία τὸ μὴ οὐχὶ ἀγανακτεῖν τῇ παρούσῃ τύχῃ .	Crito . Other men as old , Socrates , become involved in similar misfortunes , but their age does not in the least prevent them from being disturbed by their fate .	165	Crito. And others, Socrates, of such an age and in such misfortunes are captured, but their age does not relieve them of being indignant at their present fate.
Σωκράτης . ἔστι ταῦτα . ἀλλὰ τί δὴ οὕτω πρῲ ἀφῖξαι ;	Socrates . That is true . But why have you come so early ?	166	"Socrates: ""That is true. But why have you arrived so early?"""
Κρίτων . ἀγγελίαν , ὦ Σώκρατες , φέρων χαλεπήν , οὐ σοί , ὡς ἐμοὶ φαίνεται , ἀλλ᾽ ἐμοὶ καὶ τοῖς σοῖς ἐπιτηδείοις πᾶσιν καὶ χαλεπὴν καὶ βαρεῖαν , ἣν ἐγώ , ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκῶ , ἐν τοῖς βαρύτατ᾽ ἂν ἐνέγκαιμι .	Crito . To bring news , Socrates , sad news , though apparently not sad to you , but sad and grievous me and all your friends , and to few of them , I think , so grievous as to me .	167	Crito, bringing a difficult message, Socrates, not to you, as it seems to me, but to me and to all your companions, both difficult and grievous, which I, as it seems to me, could scarcely bear.
Σωκράτης . τίνα ταύτην ; ἢ τὸ πλοῖον ἀφῖκται ἐκ Δήλου , οὗ δεῖ ἀφικομένου τεθνάναι με ;	Socrates . What is this news ? Has the ship come from Delos , at the arrival of which I am to die ?	168	Socrates: What is this? Has the ship arrived from Delos, upon whose arrival I must die?
Κρίτων . οὔτοι δὴ ἀφῖκται , ἀλλὰ δοκεῖν μέν μοι ἥξει τήμερον ἐξ ὧν ἀπαγγέλλουσιν ἥκοντές τινες ἀπὸ Σουνίου καὶ καταλιπόντες ἐκεῖ αὐτό .	Crito . It has not exactly come , but I think it will come today from the reports of some men who have come from Sunium and left it there .	169	Crito: He has not yet arrived, but it seems to me that he will come today, based on reports from some who have returned from Sounion and left him there.
δῆλον οὖν ἐκ τούτων τῶν ἀγγέλων ὅτι ἥξει τήμερον , καὶ ἀνάγκη δὴ εἰς αὔριον ἔσται , ὦ Σώκρατες , τὸν βίον σε τελευτᾶν .	Now it is clear from what they say that it will come today , and so tomorrow , Socrates , your life must end .	170	It is clear then from these messages that he will come today, and it is necessary, Socrates, that you will end your life tomorrow.
Σωκράτης . ἀλλ᾽ , ὦ Κρίτων , τύχῃ ἀγαθῇ , εἰ ταύτῃ τοῖς θεοῖς φίλον , ταύτῃ ἔστω : οὐ μέντοι οἶμαι ἥξειν αὐτὸ τήμερον .	Socrates . Well , Crito , good luck be with us ! If this is the will of the gods , so be it . However , I do not think it will come today .	171	Socrates: But, Crito, so be it with good fortune, if this is pleasing to the gods, let it be so: however, I do not think it will happen today.
Κρίτων . πόθεν τοῦτο τεκμαίρῃ ;	Crito . What is your reason for not thinking so ?	172	Crito: How do you infer that?
Σωκράτης . ἐγώ σοι ἐρῶ . τῇ γάρ που ὑστεραίᾳ δεῖ με ἀποθνῄσκειν ἢ ᾗ ἂν ἔλθῃ τὸ πλοῖον .	Socrates . I will tell you . I must die on the day after the ship comes in , must I not ?	173	Socrates: I will tell you. For the next day I must die or whenever the ship arrives.
Κρίτων . φασί γέ τοι δὴ οἱ τούτων κύριοι .	Crito . So those say who have charge of these matters .	174	Crito: Indeed, their masters say so.
Σωκράτης . οὐ τοίνυν τῆς ἐπιούσης ἡμέρας οἶμαι αὐτὸ ἥξειν ἀλλὰ τῆς ἑτέρας .	Socrates . Well , I think it will not come in today , but tomorrow .	175	Socrates: I do not think it will come the next day but the one after.
τεκμαίρομαι δὲ ἔκ τινος ἐνυπνίου ὃ ἑώρακα ὀλίγον πρότερον ταύτης τῆς νυκτός : καὶ κινδυνεύεις ἐν καιρῷ τινι οὐκ ἐγεῖραί με .	And my reason for this is a dream which I had a little while ago in the course of this night . And perhaps you let me sleep just at the right time	176	I make a conjecture from a certain dream that I saw a little earlier this night: and you are likely in some time not to wake me up.
Κρίτων . ἦν δὲ δὴ τί τὸ ἐνύπνιον ;	Crito . What was the dream ?	177	Crito: And what was the dream?
"Σωκράτης . ἐδόκει τίς μοι γυνὴ προσελθοῦσα καλὴ καὶ εὐειδής , λευκὰ ἱμάτια ἔχουσα , καλέσαι με καὶ εἰπεῖν : ‘ὦ Σώκρατες , "" ἤματί κεν τριτάτῳ Φθίην ἐρίβωλον ἵκοιο . """	"Socrates . I dreamed that a beautiful , fair woman , clothed in white raiment , came to me and called me and said , "" Socrates , on the third day thou wouldst come to fertile Phthia . """	178	"Socrates: It seemed to me that a beautiful and fair woman, wearing white garments, approached and called me, saying, ""O Socrates, on the third day you will arrive at fertile Phthia."""
Κρίτων . ἄτοπον τὸ ἐνύπνιον , ὦ Σώκρατες .	Crito . A strange dream , Socrates .	179	Crito: The dream is strange, Socrates.
Σωκράτης . ἐναργὲς μὲν οὖν , ὥς γέ μοι δοκεῖ , ὦ Κρίτων .	Socrates . No , a clear one , at any rate , I think , Crito .	180	"Socrates: ""It is indeed clear, at least it seems to me, Crito."""
Κρίτων . λίαν γε , ὡς ἔοικεν .	Crito . Too clear , apparently .	181	Crito: Very much so, it seems.
ἀλλ᾽ , ὦ δαιμόνιε Σώκρατες , ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐμοὶ πιθοῦ καὶ σώθητι : ὡς ἐμοί , ἐὰν σὺ ἀποθάνῃς , οὐ μία συμφορά ἐστιν , ἀλλὰ χωρὶς μὲν τοῦ ἐστερῆσθαι τοιούτου ἐπιτηδείου οἷον ἐγὼ οὐδένα μή ποτε εὑρήσω , ἔτι δὲ καὶ πολλοῖς δόξω , οἳ ἐμὲ καὶ σὲ μὴ σαφῶς ἴσασιν , ὡς οἷός τ᾽ ὤν σε σῴζειν εἰ ἤθελον ἀναλίσκειν χρήματα , ἀμελῆσαι .	But , my dear Socrates , even now listen to me and save yourself . Since , if you die , it will be no mere single misfortune to me , but I shall lose a friend such as I can never find again , and besides , many persons who do not know you and me well will think I could have saved you if I had been willing to spend money , but that I would not take the trouble .	182	But, O divine Socrates, even now obey me and be saved. For to me, if you die, it will not be a single misfortune; but apart from being deprived of such a companion as I shall never find again, many will think, who do not know me and you clearly, that I could
καίτοι τίς ἂν αἰσχίων εἴη ταύτης δόξα ἢ δοκεῖν χρήματα περὶ πλείονος ποιεῖσθαι ἢ φίλους ; οὐ γὰρ πείσονται οἱ πολλοὶ ὡς σὺ αὐτὸς οὐκ ἠθέλησας ἀπιέναι ἐνθένδε ἡμῶν προθυμουμένων .	And yet what reputation could be more disgraceful than that of considering one ' s money of more importance than one ' s friends ? For most people will not believe that we were eager to help you to go away from here , but you refused .	183	Yet what reputation could be more shameful than this, or to seem to value money more highly than friends? For the majority will not be persuaded, since you yourself did not wish to leave here when we were eager.
Σωκράτης . ἀλλὰ τί ἡμῖν , ὦ μακάριε Κρίτων , οὕτω τῆς τῶν πολλῶν δόξης μέλει ; οἱ γὰρ ἐπιεικέστατοι , ὧν μᾶλλον ἄξιον φροντίζειν , ἡγήσονται αὐτὰ οὕτω πεπρᾶχθαι ὥσπερ ἂν πραχθῇ .	Socrates . But , my dear Crito , why do we care so much for what most people think ? For the most reasonable men , whose opinion is more worth considering , will think that things were done as they really will be done .	184	Socrates: But why, blessed Crito, do we care so much about the opinion of the many? For the most reasonable people, whose opinion is worth considering, will think that things have been done just as they have been done.
Κρίτων . ἀλλ᾽ ὁρᾷς δὴ ὅτι ἀνάγκη , ὦ Σώκρατες , καὶ τῆς τῶν πολλῶν δόξης μέλειν . αὐτὰ δὲ δῆλα τὰ παρόντα νυνὶ ὅτι οἷοί τ᾽ εἰσὶν οἱ πολλοὶ οὐ τὰ σμικρότατα τῶν κακῶν ἐξεργάζεσθαι ἀλλὰ τὰ μέγιστα σχεδόν , ἐάν τις ἐν αὐτοῖς διαβεβλημένος ᾖ .	Crito . But you see it is necessary , Socrates , to care for the opinion of the public , for this very trouble we are in now shows that the public is able to accomplish not by any means the least , but almost the greatest of evils , if one has a bad reputation with it .	185	Crito. But you see indeed, Socrates, that it is necessary to take heed of the opinion of the many. It is now clear that the multitude are indeed capable not only of inflicting the smallest of evils but also nearly the greatest, if one is slandered among them.
Σωκράτης . εἰ γὰρ ὤφελον , ὦ Κρίτων , οἷοί τ᾽ εἶναι οἱ πολλοὶ τὰ μέγιστα κακὰ ἐργάζεσθαι , ἵνα οἷοί τ᾽ ἦσαν καὶ ἀγαθὰ τὰ μέγιστα , καὶ καλῶς ἂν εἶχεν . νῦν δὲ οὐδέτερα οἷοί τε : οὔτε γὰρ φρόνιμον οὔτε ἄφρονα δυνατοὶ ποιῆσαι , ποιοῦσι δὲ τοῦτο ὅτι ἂν τύχωσι .	Socrates . I only wish , Crito , the people could accomplish the greatest evils , that they might be able to accomplish also the greatest good things . Then all would be well . But now they can do neither of the two ; for they are not able to make a man wise or foolish , but they do whatever occurs to them .	186	"Socrates: ""For if only the many were able, Crito, to cause the greatest evils, then they would also be able to achieve the greatest goods, and it would be well. But now they are capable of neither: they can neither make a man wise nor unwise, but they do whatever"
Κρίτων . ταῦτα μὲν δὴ οὕτως ἐχέτω : τάδε δέ , ὦ Σώκρατες , εἰπέ μοι . ἆρά γε μὴ ἐμοῦ προμηθῇ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἐπιτηδείων μή , ἐὰν σὺ ἐνθένδε ἐξέλθῃς , οἱ συκοφάνται ἡμῖν πράγματα παρέχωσιν ὡς σὲ ἐνθένδε ἐκκλέψασιν , καὶ ἀναγκασθῶμεν ἢ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν οὐσίαν ἀποβαλεῖν ἢ συχνὰ χρήματα , ἢ καὶ ἄλλο τι πρὸς τούτοις παθεῖν ; εἰ γάρ τι τοιοῦτον φοβῇ , ἔασον αὐτὸ χαίρειν : ἡμεῖς γάρ που δίκαιοί ἐσμεν σώσαντές σε κινδυνεύειν τοῦτον τὸν κίνδυνον καὶ ἐὰν δέῃ ἔτι τούτου μείζω .	Crito . That may well be . But , Socrates , tell me this : you are not considering me and your other friends , are you , fearing that , if you escape , the informers will make trouble for us by saying that we stole you away , and we shall be forced to lose either all our property or a good deal of money , or be punished in some other way besides ? For if you are afraid of anything of that kind , let it go ; since it is right for us to run this risk , and even greater risk than this , if necessary , provided we save you .	187	Crito: So be it; but tell me this, Socrates: Don't you worry about me and your other friends, that if you escape from here, it will bring trouble upon us, as if we had stolen you away, and we will be forced either to lose all our possessions or pay large sums of money
ἀλλ᾽ ἐμοὶ πείθου καὶ μὴ ἄλλως ποίει .	Now please do as I ask .	188	But obey me and do not act otherwise.
Σωκράτης . καὶ ταῦτα προμηθοῦμαι , ὦ Κρίτων , καὶ ἄλλα πολλά .	Socrates . I am considering this , Crito , and many other things .	189	Socrates: And I take care of these things, Crito, and many others besides.
Κρίτων . μήτε τοίνυν ταῦτα φοβοῦ — καὶ γὰρ οὐδὲ πολὺ τἀργύριόν ἐστιν ὃ θέλουσι λαβόντες τινὲς σῶσαί σε καὶ ἐξαγαγεῖν ἐνθένδε .	Crito . Well , do not fear this ! for it is not even a large sum of money which we should pay to some men who are willing to save you and get you away from here .	190	Crito: So do not fear these things — for the money is not much that some want to take to save you and get you out of here.
ἔπειτα οὐχ ὁρᾷς τούτους τοὺς συκοφάντας ὡς εὐτελεῖς , καὶ οὐδὲν ἂν δέοι ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς πολλοῦ ἀργυρίου ;	Besides , don ' t you see how cheap these informers are , and that not much money would be needed to silence them ?	191	Then don't you see how worthless these sycophants are, and wouldn't it take much money against them?
σοὶ δὲ ὑπάρχει μὲν τὰ ἐμὰ χρήματα , ὡς ἐγὼ οἶμαι , ἱκανά : ἔπειτα καὶ εἴ τι ἐμοῦ κηδόμενος οὐκ οἴει δεῖν ἀναλίσκειν τἀμά , ξένοι οὗτοι ἐνθάδε ἕτοιμοι ἀναλίσκειν : εἷς δὲ καὶ κεκόμικεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἀργύριον ἱκανόν , Σιμμίας ὁ Θηβαῖος , ἕτοιμος δὲ καὶ Κέβης καὶ ἄλλοι πολλοὶ πάνυ .	And you have my money at your command , which is enough , I fancy ; and moreover , if because you care for me you think you ought not to spend my money , there are foreigners here willing to spend theirs ; and one of them , Simmias of Thebes , has brought for this especial purpose sufficient funds ; and Cebes also and very many others are ready .	192	But you have my money, which I think is sufficient; and besides, if you think it is not right to spend my own funds because you are concerned for me, these strangers here are ready to spend theirs. One of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a sufficient amount of silver for this very
ὥστε , ὅπερ λέγω , μήτε ταῦτα φοβούμενος ἀποκάμῃς σαυτὸν σῶσαι , μήτε , ὃ ἔλεγες ἐν τῷ δικαστηρίῳ , δυσχερές σοι γενέσθω ὅτι οὐκ ἂν ἔχοις ἐξελθὼν ὅτι χρῷο σαυτῷ :	So , as I say , do not give up saving yourself through fear of this . And do not be troubled by what you said in the court , that if you went away you would not know what to do with yourself .	193	Therefore, as I say, do not wear yourself out trying to save yourself because of fear of these things, nor let it be difficult for you, as you said in the court, that you would not be able to go out and deal with yourself.
πολλαχοῦ μὲν γὰρ καὶ ἄλλοσε ὅποι ἂν ἀφίκῃ ἀγαπήσουσί σε : ἐὰν δὲ βούλῃ εἰς Θετταλίαν ἰέναι , εἰσὶν ἐμοὶ ἐκεῖ ξένοι οἵ σε περὶ πολλοῦ ποιήσονται καὶ ἀσφάλειάν σοι παρέξονται , ὥστε σε μηδένα λυπεῖν τῶν κατὰ Θετταλίαν .	For in many other places , wherever you go , they will welcome you ; and if you wish to go to Thessaly , I have friends there who will make much of you and will protect you , so that no one in Thessaly shall annoy you .	194	For in many places and elsewhere wherever you might arrive, they will love you: But if you wish to go to Thessaly, I have friends there who will treat you highly and provide you with security, so that none of the Thessalians will harm you.
ἔτι δέ , ὦ Σώκρατες , οὐδὲ δίκαιόν μοι δοκεῖς ἐπιχειρεῖν πρᾶγμα , σαυτὸν προδοῦναι , ἐξὸν σωθῆναι , καὶ τοιαῦτα σπεύδεις περὶ σαυτὸν γενέσθαι ἅπερ ἂν καὶ οἱ ἐχθροί σου σπεύσαιέν τε καὶ ἔσπευσαν σὲ διαφθεῖραι βουλόμενοι .	And besides , Socrates , it seems to me the thing you are undertaking to do is not even right — betraying yourself when you might save yourself . And you are eager to bring upon yourself just what your enemies would wish and just what those were eager for who wished to destroy you .	195	Moreover, O Socrates, it seems to me that you are attempting something unjust, to betray yourself when it is possible to be saved, and you are eager for things to happen to yourself which even your enemies would hasten and have hastened, desiring to destroy you.
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις καὶ τοὺς ὑεῖς τοὺς σαυτοῦ ἔμοιγε δοκεῖς προδιδόναι , οὕς σοι ἐξὸν καὶ ἐκθρέψαι καὶ ἐκπαιδεῦσαι οἰχήσῃ καταλιπών , καὶ τὸ σὸν μέρος ὅτι ἂν τύχωσι τοῦτο πράξουσιν : τεύξονται δέ , ὡς τὸ εἰκός , τοιούτων οἷάπερ εἴωθεν γίγνεσθαι ἐν ταῖς ὀρφανίαις περὶ τοὺς ὀρφανούς .	And moreover , I think you are abandoning your children , too , for when you might bring them up and educate them , you are going to desert them and go away , and , so far as you are concerned , their fortunes in life will be whatever they happen to meet with , and they will probably meet with such treatment as generally comes to orphans in their destitution .	196	Moreover, it seems to me that you are betraying your own sons, whom you could both nurture and educate, but you are going away leaving them behind, and that whatever happens to them will be what they will experience: and they are likely to encounter such things as usually happen to orphans.
ἢ γὰρ οὐ χρὴ ποιεῖσθαι παῖδας ἢ συνδιαταλαιπωρεῖν καὶ τρέφοντα καὶ παιδεύοντα , σὺ δέ μοι δοκεῖς τὰ ῥᾳθυμότατα αἱρεῖσθαι . χρὴ δέ , ἅπερ ἂν ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς καὶ ἀνδρεῖος ἕλοιτο , ταῦτα αἱρεῖσθαι , φάσκοντά γε δὴ ἀρετῆς διὰ παντὸς τοῦ βίου ἐπιμελεῖσθαι :	No . Either one ought not to beget children , or one ought to stay by them and bring them up and educate them . But you seem to me to be choosing the laziest way ; and you ought to choose as a good and brave man would choose , you who have been saying all your life that you cared for virtue .	197	For one ought either not to have children or to endure the hardship of raising and educating them, but you seem to me to choose the easiest way. It is necessary to choose what a good and brave man would choose, professing to care for virtue throughout all of life.
Σωκράτης . ὦ φίλε Κρίτων , ἡ προθυμία σου πολλοῦ ἀξία εἰ μετά τινος ὀρθότητος εἴη : εἰ δὲ μή , ὅσῳ μείζων τοσούτῳ χαλεπωτέρα .	Socrates . My dear Crito , your eagerness is worth a great deal , if it should prove to be rightly directed ; but otherwise , the greater it is , the more hard to bear .	198	Socrates: O dear Crito, your eagerness is worth much if it be accompanied by some correctness; but if not, the greater it is, so much the more troublesome.
σκοπεῖσθαι οὖν χρὴ ἡμᾶς εἴτε ταῦτα πρακτέον εἴτε μή : ὡς ἐγὼ οὐ νῦν πρῶτον ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀεὶ τοιοῦτος οἷος τῶν ἐμῶν μηδενὶ ἄλλῳ πείθεσθαι ἢ τῷ λόγῳ ὃς ἄν μοι λογιζομένῳ βέλτιστος φαίνηται .	So we must examine the question whether we ought to do this or not ; for I am not only now but always a man who follows nothing but the reasoning which on consideration seems to me best .	199	It is necessary for us to consider whether these things must be done or not; as for me, I am always such a person who yields to no one else except to the reason which, when I deliberate, appears best to me.
τοὺς δὴ λόγους οὓς ἐν τῷ ἔμπροσθεν ἔλεγον οὐ δύναμαι νῦν ἐκβαλεῖν , ἐπειδή μοι ἥδε ἡ τύχη γέγονεν , ἀλλὰ σχεδόν τι ὅμοιοι φαίνονταί μοι , καὶ τοὺς αὐτοὺς πρεσβεύω καὶ τιμῶ οὕσπερ καὶ πρότερον :	And I cannot , now that this has happened to us , discard the arguments I used to advance , but they seem to me much the same as ever , and I revere and honor the same ones as before .	200	The words which I spoke previously I cannot now retract, since this fate has befallen me, but they seem to me nearly the same, and I advocate and honor the same things as before.
ὧν ἐὰν μὴ βελτίω ἔχωμεν λέγειν ἐν τῷ παρόντι , εὖ ἴσθι ὅτι οὐ μή σοι συγχωρήσω , οὐδ᾽ ἂν πλείω τῶν νῦν παρόντων ἡ τῶν πολλῶν δύναμις ὥσπερ παῖδας ἡμᾶς μορμολύττηται , δεσμοὺς καὶ θανάτους ἐπιπέμπουσα καὶ χρημάτων ἀφαιρέσεις .	And unless we can bring forward better ones in our present situation , be assured that I shall not give way to you , not even if the power of the multitude frighten us with even more terrors than at present , as children are frightened with goblins , threatening us with imprisonments and deaths and confiscations of property .	201	If we cannot say anything better in the present, be assured that I will not agree with you, even if the power of the many, frightening us like children with threats of bonds and death and confiscation of property, is greater than those now present.
πῶς οὖν ἂν μετριώτατα σκοποίμεθα αὐτά ; εἰ πρῶτον μὲν τοῦτον τὸν λόγον ἀναλάβοιμεν , ὃν σὺ λέγεις περὶ τῶν δοξῶν . πότερον καλῶς ἐλέγετο ἑκάστοτε ἢ οὔ , ὅτι ταῖς μὲν δεῖ τῶν δοξῶν προσέχειν τὸν νοῦν , ταῖς δὲ οὔ ;	Now how could we examine the matter most reasonably ? By taking up first what you say about opinions and asking whether we were right when we always used to say that we ought to pay attention to some opinions and not to others ?	202	How then could we examine these things most moderately? If, first of all, we take up this argument, which you speak about concerning opinions. Was it rightly said each time or not, that one ought to heed some opinions and not others?
ἢ πρὶν μὲν ἐμὲ δεῖν ἀποθνῄσκειν καλῶς ἐλέγετο , νῦν δὲ κατάδηλος ἄρα ἐγένετο ὅτι ἄλλως ἕνεκα λόγου ἐλέγετο , ἦν δὲ παιδιὰ καὶ φλυαρία ὡς ἀληθῶς ; ἐπιθυμῶ δ᾽ ἔγωγ᾽ ἐπισκέψασθαι , ὦ Κρίτων , κοινῇ μετὰ σοῦ εἴ τί μοι ἀλλοιότερος φανεῖται , ἐπειδὴ ὧδε ἔχω , ἢ ὁ αὐτός , καὶ ἐάσομεν χαίρειν ἢ πεισόμεθα αὐτῷ .	Or were we right before I was condemned to death , whereas it has now been made clear that we were talking merely for the sake of argument and it was really mere play and nonsense ? And I wish to investigate , Crito , in common with you , and see whether our former argument seems different to me under our present conditions , or the same , and whether we shall give it up or be guided by it .	203	"""Was it said before that I must die nobly, but now it has become clear that it was said otherwise for some other reason, and truly it was a joke and idle talk? I am eager, Crito, to examine together with you whether I will appear different in any way, since I am in this"
ἐλέγετο δέ πως , ὡς ἐγᾦμαι , ἑκάστοτε ὧδε ὑπὸ τῶν οἰομένων τὶ λέγειν , ὥσπερ νυνδὴ ἐγὼ ἔλεγον , ὅτι τῶν δοξῶν ἃς οἱ ἄνθρωποι δοξάζουσιν δέοι τὰς μὲν περὶ πολλοῦ ποιεῖσθαι , τὰς δὲ μή .	But it used to be said , I think , by those who thought they were speaking sensibly , just as I was saying now , that of the opinions held by men some ought to be highly esteemed and others not .	204	It was said somehow, as I suppose, each time in this way by those who thought they were saying something, just as I was saying now, that of the opinions which men believe, some should be highly regarded, and others not.
τοῦτο πρὸς θεῶν , ὦ Κρίτων , οὐ δοκεῖ καλῶς σοι λέγεσθαι ; —	In God ' s name , Crito , do you not think this is correct ?	205	By the gods, Crito, does this not seem well said to you?
σὺ γάρ , ὅσα γε τἀνθρώπεια , ἐκτὸς εἶ τοῦ μέλλειν ἀποθνῄσκειν αὔριον , καὶ οὐκ ἂν σὲ παρακρούοι ἡ παροῦσα συμφορά : σκόπει δή — οὐχ ἱκανῶς δοκεῖ σοι λέγεσθαι ὅτι οὐ πάσας χρὴ τὰς δόξας τῶν ἀνθρώπων τιμᾶν ἀλλὰ τὰς μέν , τὰς δ᾽ οὔ , οὐδὲ πάντων ἀλλὰ τῶν μέν , τῶν δ᾽ οὔ ; τί φῄς ; ταῦτα οὐχὶ καλῶς λέγεται ;	For you , humanly speaking , are not involved in the necessity of dying tomorrow , and therefore present conditions would not lead your judgment astray . Now say , do you not think we were correct in saying that we ought not to esteem all the opinions of men , but some and not others , and not those of all men , but only of some ? What do you think ? Is not this true ?	206	For you, as far as human affairs go, are exempt from fearing death tomorrow, and the present misfortune would not shake you. Consider, then—does it not seem sufficiently said that not all opinions of men should be honored, but some, and not others, and not all men, but some, and not
Κρίτων . καλῶς .	Crito . It is .	207	Criton: well.
Σωκράτης . οὐκοῦν τὰς μὲν χρηστὰς τιμᾶν , τὰς δὲ πονηρὰς μή ;	Socrates . Then we ought to esteem the good opinions and not the bad ones ?	208	Socrates: Should we not honor the good ones and not the bad ones?
Κρίτων . ναί .	Crito . Yes .	209	Crito: Yes.
Σωκράτης . χρησταὶ δὲ οὐχ αἱ τῶν φρονίμων , πονηραὶ δὲ αἱ τῶν ἀφρόνων ;	Socrates . And the good ones are those of the wise and the bad ones those of the foolish ?	210	Socrates: But are not the actions of the wise good, and those of the foolish evil?
Κρίτων . πῶς δ᾽ οὔ ;	Crito . Of course .	211	Crito: How could it not be?
Σωκράτης . φέρε δή , πῶς αὖ τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐλέγετο ; γυμναζόμενος ἀνὴρ καὶ τοῦτο πράττων πότερον παντὸς ἀνδρὸς ἐπαίνῳ καὶ ψόγῳ καὶ δόξῃ τὸν νοῦν προσέχει , ἢ ἑνὸς μόνου ἐκείνου ὃς ἂν τυγχάνῃ ἰατρὸς ἢ παιδοτρίβης ὤν ;	Socrates . Come then , what used we to say about this ? If a man is an athlete and makes that his business , does he pay attention to every man ' s praise and blame and opinion or to those of one man only who is a physician or a trainer ?	212	Socrates: Come now, how was it said again about such things? Should a man who is exercising and doing this pay attention to the praise or blame and opinion of any man, or only to that of the one person who happens to be a doctor or trainer?
Κρίτων . ἑνὸς μόνου .	Crito . To those of one man only .	213	Crito. Of one only.
Σωκράτης . οὐκοῦν φοβεῖσθαι χρὴ τοὺς ψόγους καὶ ἀσπάζεσθαι τοὺς ἐπαίνους τοὺς τοῦ ἑνὸς ἐκείνου ἀλλὰ μὴ τοὺς τῶν πολλῶν .	Socrates . Then he ought to fear the blame and welcome the praise of that one man and not of the multitude .	214	Socrates: Therefore one must fear criticism and welcome praise from that one person rather than from the many.
Κρίτων . δῆλα δή .	Crito . Obviously .	215	Crito: Clearly, indeed.
Σωκράτης . ταύτῃ ἄρα αὐτῷ πρακτέον καὶ γυμναστέον καὶ ἐδεστέον γε καὶ ποτέον , ᾗ ἂν τῷ ἑνὶ δοκῇ , τῷ ἐπιστάτῃ καὶ ἐπαΐοντι , μᾶλλον ἢ ᾗ σύμπασι τοῖς ἄλλοις .	Socrates . And he must act and exercise and eat and drink as the one man who is his director and who knows the business thinks best rather than as all the others think .	216	Socrates: In this way, one should act and exercise and eat and drink as it seems good to the one who is knowledgeable and skilled rather than to all others.
Κρίτων . ἔστι ταῦτα .	Crito . That is true .	217	Crito: That is so.
Σωκράτης . εἶεν . ἀπειθήσας δὲ τῷ ἑνὶ καὶ ἀτιμάσας αὐτοῦ τὴν δόξαν καὶ τοὺς ἐπαίνους , τιμήσας δὲ τοὺς τῶν πολλῶν λόγους καὶ μηδὲν ἐπαϊόντων , ἆρα οὐδὲν κακὸν πείσεται ; γ	Socrates . Well then ; if he disobeys the one man and disregards his opinion and his praise , but regards words of the many who have no special knowledge , will he not come to harm ?	218	Socrates: Well, if he disobeys the one and dishonors his reputation and praises, but values the words of the many who know nothing, will he not suffer any harm?
Κρίτων . πῶς γὰρ οὔ ;	Crito . Of course he will .	219	Crito: How could it not be?
Σωκράτης . τί δ᾽ ἔστι τὸ κακὸν τοῦτο , καὶ ποῖ τείνει , καὶ εἰς τί τῶν τοῦ ἀπειθοῦντος ;	Socrates . And what is this harm ? In what direction and upon what part of the one who disobeys does it act ?	220	Socrates: What is this evil, and to what does it tend, and into what of those of the disobedient?
Κρίτων . δῆλον ὅτι εἰς τὸ σῶμα : τοῦτο γὰρ διόλλυσι .	Crito . Evidently upon his body ; for that is what it ruins .	221	Crito: It is clear that it concerns the body, for this destroys it.
Σωκράτης . καλῶς λέγεις . οὐκοῦν καὶ τἆλλα , ὦ Κρίτων , οὕτως , ἵνα μὴ πάντα διΐωμεν , καὶ δὴ καὶ περὶ τῶν δικαίων καὶ ἀδίκων καὶ αἰσχρῶν καὶ καλῶν καὶ ἀγαθῶν καὶ κακῶν , περὶ ὧν νῦν ἡ βουλὴ ἡμῖν ἐστιν , πότερον τῇ τῶν πολλῶν δόξῃ δεῖ ἡμᾶς ἕπεσθαι καὶ φοβεῖσθαι αὐτὴν ἢ τῇ τοῦ ἑνός , εἴ τίς ἐστιν ἐπαΐων , ὃν δεῖ καὶ αἰσχύνεσθαι καὶ φοβεῖσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ σύμπαντας τοὺς ἄλλους ; ᾧ εἰ μὴ ἀκολουθήσομεν , διαφθεροῦμεν ἐκεῖνο καὶ λωβησόμεθα , ὃ τῷ μὲν δικαίῳ βέλτιον ἐγίγνετο τῷ δὲ ἀδίκῳ ἀπώλλυτο . ἢ οὐδέν ἐστι τοῦτο ;	Socrates . Right . Then in other matters , not to enumerate them all , in questions of right and wrong and disgraceful and noble and good and bad , which we are now considering , ought we to follow and fear the opinion of the many or that of the one , if there is anyone who knows about them , whom we ought to revere and fear more than all the others ? And if we do not follow him , we shall injure and cripple that which we used to say is benefited by the right and is ruined by the wrong . Or is there nothing in this ?	222	"Socrates: ""You speak well. Then, should not the same apply to other matters, Crito, so as not to consider them all in detail, and indeed concerning what is just and unjust, shameful and beautiful, good and bad, about which we are now deliberating; whether we ought to follow"
Κρίτων . οἶμαι ἔγωγε , ὦ Σώκρατες .	Crito . I think it is true , Socrates .	223	Crito: I think so, Socrates.
Σωκράτης . φέρε δή , ἐὰν τὸ ὑπὸ τοῦ ὑγιεινοῦ μὲν βέλτιον γιγνόμενον , ὑπὸ τοῦ νοσώδους δὲ διαφθειρόμενον διολέσωμεν πειθόμενοι μὴ τῇ τῶν ἐπαϊόντων δόξῃ , ἆρα βιωτὸν ἡμῖν ἐστιν διεφθαρμένου αὐτοῦ ; ἔστι δέ που τοῦτο σῶμα : ἢ οὐχί ;	Socrates . Well then , if through yielding to the opinion of the ignorant we ruin that which is benefited by health and injured by disease , is life worth living for us when that is ruined ? And that is the body , is it not ?	224	Socrates: Come now, if we destroy what becomes better under the influence of what is healthy, but is corrupted under the influence of what is diseased, by not following the opinion of the experts, is it possible for us to live after it is destroyed? And this, presumably, is the body, or
Κρίτων . ναί .	Crito . Yes .	225	Crito: Yes.
Σωκράτης . ἆρ᾽ οὖν βιωτὸν ἡμῖν ἐστιν μετὰ μοχθηροῦ καὶ διεφθαρμένου σώματος ;	Socrates . Then is life worth living when the body is worthless and ruined ?	226	"Socrates: ""Is life worth living for us with a wicked and corrupt body?"""
Κρίτων . οὐδαμῶς .	Crito . Certainly not .	227	Crito: Not at all.
Σωκράτης . ἀλλὰ μετ᾽ ἐκείνου ἄρ᾽ ἡμῖν βιωτὸν διεφθαρμένου , ᾧ τὸ ἄδικον μὲν λωβᾶται , τὸ δὲ δίκαιον ὀνίνησιν ; ἢ φαυλότερον ἡγούμεθα εἶναι τοῦ σώματος ἐκεῖνο , ὅτι ποτ᾽ ἐστὶ τῶν ἡμετέρων , περὶ ὃ ἥ τε ἀδικία καὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη ἐστίν ;	Socrates . But is it worth living when that is ruined which is injured by the wrong and improved by the right ? Or do we think that part of us , whatever it is , which is concerned with right and wrong , is less important than the body ?	228	Socrates: But is life bearable for us with that [part] of us corrupted, [that part] through which injustice harms and justice benefits? Or do we consider that which pertains to our body to be of less worth than that which concerns justice and injustice?
Κρίτων . οὐδαμῶς .	Crito . By no means .	229	Crito: By no means.
Σωκράτης . ἀλλὰ τιμιώτερον ;	Socrates . But more important ?	230	Socrates: But what is more honorable?
Κρίτων . πολύ γε .	Crito . Much more .	231	Crito: Very much so.
Σωκράτης . οὐκ ἄρα , ὦ βέλτιστε , πάνυ ἡμῖν οὕτω φροντιστέον τί ἐροῦσιν οἱ πολλοὶ ἡμᾶς , ἀλλ᾽ ὅτι ὁ ἐπαΐων περὶ τῶν δικαίων καὶ ἀδίκων , ὁ εἷς καὶ αὐτὴ ἡ ἀλήθεια .	Socrates . Then , most excellent friend , we must not consider at all what the many will say of us , but what he who knows about right and wrong , the one man , and truth herself will say .	232	"Socrates: ""So, my good man, we should not be overly concerned with what the many will say to us, but rather with what the knowledgeable one about justice and injustice, the one expert, and the very truth will say."""
ὥστε πρῶτον μὲν ταύτῃ οὐκ ὀρθῶς εἰσηγῇ , εἰσηγούμενος τῆς τῶν πολλῶν δόξης δεῖν ἡμᾶς φροντίζειν περὶ τῶν δικαίων καὶ καλῶν καὶ ἀγαθῶν καὶ τῶν ἐναντίων .	And so you introduced the discussion wrongly in the first place , when you began by saying we ought to consider the opinion of the multitude about the right and the noble and the good and their opposites .	233	So, first, you are not correctly advising her in this, advising that we ought to care about the opinions of the many concerning what is just, noble, good, and their opposites.
ἔννοιά ποθ᾽ ἡμῖν ἐγένετο ὅσαι δημοκρατίαι κατελύθησαν ὑπὸ τῶν ἄλλως πως βουλομένων πολιτεύεσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ ἐν δημοκρατίᾳ , ὅσαι τ᾽ αὖ μοναρχίαι , ὅσαι τε ὀλιγαρχίαι ἀνῄρηνται ἤδη ὑπὸ δήμων , καὶ ὅσοι τυραννεῖν ἐπιχειρήσαντες οἱ μὲν αὐτῶν καὶ ταχὺ πάμπαν κατελύθησαν , οἱ δὲ κἂν ὁποσονοῦν χρόνον ἄρχοντες διαγένωνται , θαυμάζονται ὡς σοφοί τε καὶ εὐτυχεῖς ἄνδρες γεγενημένοι .	The thought once occurred to us how many republics have been overthrown by people who preferred to live under any form of government other than a republican , and again , how many monarchies and how many oligarchies in times past have been abolished by the people . We reflected , moreover , how many of those individuals who have aspired to absolute power have either been deposed once for all and that right quickly ; or if they have continued in power , no matter for how short a time , they are objects of wonder as having proved to be wise and happy men .	234	At one time, we considered how many democracies were destroyed by those wishing to govern in another manner rather than in a democracy, and how many monarchies, and how many oligarchies have already been overthrown by the people, and how many attempted to become tyrants, some of whom were quickly utterly destroyed
πολλοὺς δ᾽ ἐδοκοῦμεν καταμεμαθηκέναι καὶ ἐν ἰδίοις οἴκοις τοὺς μὲν ἔχοντας καὶ πλείονας οἰκέτας , τοὺς δὲ καὶ πάνυ ὀλίγους , καὶ ὅμως οὐδὲ τοῖς ὀλίγοις τούτοις πάνυ τι δυναμένους χρῆσθαι πειθομένοις τοὺς δεσπότας .	Then , too , we had observed , we thought , that even in private homes some people who had rather more than the usual number of servants and some also who had only a very few were nevertheless , though nominally masters , quite unable to assert their authority over even those few .	235	And we seemed to have observed many, both in their own homes, some having more servants, and others very few, yet not being able to manage even those few effectively, who were not obedient to their masters.
ἔτι δὲ πρὸς τούτοις ἐνενοοῦμεν ὅτι ἄρχοντες μέν εἰσι καὶ οἱ βουκόλοι τῶν βοῶν καὶ οἱ ἱπποφορβοὶ τῶν ἵππων , καὶ πάντες δὲ οἱ καλούμενοι νομεῖς ὧν ἂν ἐπιστατῶσι ζῴων εἰκότως ἂν ἄρχοντες τούτων νομίζοιντο : πάσας τοίνυν ταύτας τὰς ἀγέλας ἐδοκοῦμεν ὁρᾶν μᾶλλον ἐθελούσας πείθεσθαι τοῖς νομεῦσιν ἢ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοῖς ἄρχουσι .	And in addition to this , we reflected that cowherds are the rulers of their cattle , that grooms are the rulers of their horses , and that all who are called herdsmen might properly be regarded as the rulers of the animals over which they are placed in charge . Now we noticed , as we thought , that all these herds obeyed their keepers more readily than men obey their rulers .	236	Moreover, we thought that both the herdsmen of the oxen and the keepers of the horses are rulers, and in general, all those who are called herdsmen of any animals they oversee would naturally be considered rulers of these animals. Thus, we seemed to observe that all these herds are more willing
πορεύονταί τε γὰρ αἱ ἀγέλαι ᾗ ἂν αὐτὰς εὐθύνωσιν οἱ νομεῖς , νέμονταί τε χωρία ἐφ᾽ ὁποῖα ἂν αὐτὰς ἐπάγωσιν , ἀπέχονταί τε ὧν ἂν αὐτὰς ἀπείργωσι : καὶ τοῖς καρποῖς τοίνυν τοῖς γιγνομένοις ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐῶσι τοὺς νομέας χρῆσθαι οὕτως ὅπως ἂν αὐτοὶ βούλωνται .	For the herds go wherever their keeper directs them and graze in those places to which he leads them and keep out of those from which he excludes them . They allow their keeper , moreover , to enjoy , just as he will , the profits that accrue from them .	237	The herds go wherever the herdsmen direct them, graze in whatever places they are led to, and keep away from those from which they are driven. And the herdsmen are allowed to use the produce from them as they wish.
ἔτι τοίνυν οὐδεμίαν πώποτε ἀγέλην ᾐσθήμεθα συστᾶσαν ἐπὶ τὸν νομέα οὔτε ὡς μὴ πείθεσθαι οὔτε ὡς μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν τῷ καρπῷ χρῆσθαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ χαλεπώτεραί εἰσιν αἱ ἀγέλαι πᾶσι τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις ἢ τοῖς ἄρχουσί τε καὶ ὠφελουμένοις ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν : ἄνθρωποι δὲ ἐπ᾽ οὐδένας μᾶλλον συνίστανται ἢ ἐπὶ τούτους οὓς ἂν αἴσθωνται ἄρχειν αὑτῶν ἐπιχειροῦντας .	And then again , we have never known of a herd conspiring against its keeper , either to refuse obedience to him or to deny him the privilege of enjoying the profits that accrue . At the same time , herds are more intractable to strangers than to their rulers and those who derive profit from them . Men , however , conspire against none sooner than against those whom they see attempting to rule over them .	238	Yet indeed, we have never perceived any herd gathering together against the herdsman, either to disobey him or to prevent him from using the fruits, but the herds are even harsher to all outsiders than to those who rule and benefit from them. But men gather together against none more than those whom they
ὅτε μὲν δὴ ταῦτα ἐνεθυμούμεθα , οὕτως ἐγιγνώσκομεν περὶ αὐτῶν , ὡς ἀνθρώπῳ πεφυκότι πάντων τῶν ἄλλων ῥᾷον εἴη ζῴων ἢ ἀνθρώπων ἄρχειν .	Thus , as we meditated on this analogy , we were inclined to conclude that for man , as he is constituted , it is easier to rule over any and all other creatures than to rule over men .	239	When we considered these things, we judged about them in this way, that for a person by nature it would be easier to rule all other animals than humans.
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἐνενοήσαμεν ὅτι Κῦρος ἐγένετο Πέρσης , ὃς παμπόλλους μὲν ἀνθρώπους ἐκτήσατο πειθομένους αὑτῷ , παμπόλλας δὲ πόλεις , πάμπολλα δὲ ἔθνη , ἐκ τούτου δὴ ἠναγκαζόμεθα μετανοεῖν μὴ οὔτε τῶν ἀδυνάτων οὔτε τῶν χαλεπῶν ἔργων ᾖ τὸ ἀνθρώπων ἄρχειν , ἤν τις ἐπισταμένως τοῦτο πράττῃ .	But when we reflected that there was one Cyrus , the Persian , who reduced to obedience a vast number of men and cities and nations , we were then compelled to change our opinion and decide that to rule men might be a task neither impossible nor even difficult , if one should only go about it in an intelligent manner .	240	Since we perceived that Cyrus became a Persian, who acquired very many people obeying him, very many cities, and very many nations, from this we were compelled to change our mind that ruling over men is neither an impossible nor a difficult task, if one does it skillfully.
Κύρῳ γοῦν ἴσμεν ἐθελήσαντας πείθεσθαι τοὺς μὲν ἀπέχοντας παμπόλλων ἡμερῶν ὁδόν , τοὺς δὲ καὶ μηνῶν , τοὺς δὲ οὐδ᾽ ἑωρακότας πώποτ᾽ αὐτόν , τοὺς δὲ καὶ εὖ εἰδότας ὅτι οὐδ᾽ ἂν ἴδοιεν , καὶ ὅμως ἤθελον αὐτῷ ὑπακούειν .	At all events , we know that people obeyed Cyrus willingly , although some of them were distant from him a journey of many days , and others of many months ; others , although they had never seen him , and still others who knew well that they never should see him . Nevertheless they were all willing to be his subjects .	241	"""At least we know that Cyrus succeeded in persuading some who were a journey of many days away, others of many months, some who had never seen him, and even some who were well aware that they would never see him, and yet they were willing to obey him."""
καὶ τοίνυν τούτων τῶν ἐθνῶν ἦρξεν οὔτε αὐτῷ ὁμογλώττων ὄντων οὔτε ἀλλήλοις , καὶ ὅμως ἐδυνάσθη ἐφικέσθαι μὲν ἐπὶ τοσαύτην γῆν τῷ ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ φόβῳ , ὥστε καταπλῆξαι πάντας καὶ μηδένα ἐπιχειρεῖν αὐτῷ , ἐδυνάσθη δὲ ἐπιθυμίαν ἐμβαλεῖν τοσαύτην τοῦ πάντας αὐτῷ χαρίζεσθαι ὥστε ἀεὶ τῇ αὐτοῦ γνώμῃ ἀξιοῦν κυβερνᾶσθαι , ἀνηρτήσατο δὲ τοσαῦτα φῦλα ὅσα καὶ διελθεῖν ἔργον ἐστίν , ὅποι ἂν ἄρξηταί τις πορεύεσθαι ἀπὸ τῶν βασιλείων , ἤν τε πρὸς ἕω ἤν τε πρὸς ἑσπέραν ἤν τε πρὸς ἄρκτον ἤν τε πρὸς μεσημβρίαν .	He ruled over these nations , even though they did not speak the same language as he , nor one nation the same as another ; for all that , he was able to cover so vast a region with the fear which he inspired , that he struck all men with terror and no one tried to withstand him ; and he was able to awaken in all so lively a desire to please him , that they always wished to be guided by his will . Moreover , the tribes that he brought into subjection to himself were so many that it is a difficult matter even to travel to them all , in whatever direction one begin one ' s journey from the palace , whether toward the east or the west , toward the north or the south .	242	And so, he ruled over these nations, although they neither spoke the same language nor shared kinship with each other, and yet he was able to command such extensive territory through the fear he inspired, so as to astonish everyone and make no one dare to oppose him, and he was able to instill such a
ἡμεῖς μὲν δὴ ὡς ἄξιον ὄντα θαυμάζεσθαι τοῦτον τὸν ἄνδρα ἐσκεψάμεθα τίς ποτ᾽ ὢν γενεὰν καὶ ποίαν τινὰ φύσιν ἔχων καὶ ποίᾳ τινὶ παιδευθεὶς παιδείᾳ τοσοῦτον διήνεγκεν εἰς τὸ ἄρχειν ἀνθρώπων .	Believing this man to be deserving of all admiration , we have therefore investigated who he was in his origin , what natural endowments he possessed , and what sort of education he had enjoyed , that he so greatly excelled in governing men .	243	We indeed considered this man worthy of admiration, and inquired into what sort of lineage he was from, what nature he possessed, and what education he received that made him so distinguished in ruling people.
ὅσα οὖν καὶ ἐπυθόμεθα καὶ ᾐσθῆσθαι δοκοῦμεν περὶ αὐτοῦ , ταῦτα πειρασόμεθα διηγήσασθαι .	Accordingly , what we have found out or think we know concerning him we shall now endeavour to present .	244	Therefore, whatever we have heard or seem to have perceived about it, we shall endeavor to narrate.
πατρὸς μὲν δὴ ὁ Κῦρος λέγεται γενέσθαι Καμβύσου Περσῶν βασιλέως : ὁ δὲ Καμβύσης οὗτος τοῦ Περσειδῶν γένους ἦν : οἱ δὲ Περσεῖδαι ἀπὸ Περσέως κλῄζονται : μητρὸς δὲ ὁμολογεῖται Μανδάνης γενέσθαι : ἡ δὲ Μανδάνη αὕτη Ἀστυάγους ἦν θυγάτηρ τοῦ Μήδων γενομένου βασιλέως .	The father of Cyrus is said to have been Cambyses , king of the Persians : this Cambyses belonged to the stock of the Persidae , and the Persidae derive their name from Perseus . His mother , it is generally agreed , was Mandane ; and this Mandane was the daughter of Astyages , sometime king of the Medes .	245	Cyrus is said to have been the son of Cambyses, king of the Persians. This Cambyses belonged to the race of the Persians, who are named after Perseus. His mother is agreed to have been Mandane, and this Mandane was the daughter of Astyages, king of the Med
φῦναι δὲ ὁ Κῦρος λέγεται καὶ ᾁδεται ἔτι καὶ νῦν ὑπὸ τῶν βαρβάρων εἶδος μὲν κάλλιστος , ψυχὴν δὲ φιλανθρωπότατος καὶ φιλομαθέστατος καὶ φιλοτιμότατος , ὥστε πάντα μὲν πόνον ἀνατλῆναι , πάντα δὲ κίνδυνον ὑπομεῖναι τοῦ ἐπαινεῖσθαι ἕνεκα .	And even to this day the barbarians tell in story and in song that Cyrus was most handsome in person , most generous of heart , most devoted to learning , and most ambitious , so that he endured all sorts of labour and faced all sorts of danger for the sake of praise .	246	Cyrus is said and sung even now among the barbarians to have been most beautiful in appearance, most humane in soul, most eager to learn, and most ambitious, so that he endured every labor and faced every danger for the sake of being praised.
διὰ τοῦτο δὲ δημοσίᾳ τοῦ θηρᾶν ἐπιμέλονται , καὶ βασιλεὺς ὥσπερ καὶ ἐν πολέμῳ ἡγεμών ἐστιν αὐτοῖς καὶ αὐτός τε θηρᾷ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἐπιμελεῖται ὅπως ἂν θηρῶσιν , ὅτι ἀληθεστάτη αὐτοῖς δοκεῖ εἶναι αὕτη ἡ μελέτη τῶν πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον .	They provide for such hunting out of the public treasury ; and as the king is their leader in war , so he not only takes part in the hunt himself but sees to it that the others hunt , too . The state bears the expense of the hunting for the reason that the training it gives seems to be the best preparation for war itself .	247	For this reason, they publicly take care of hunting, and the king is their leader just as in war, and he himself hunts and takes care that the others also hunt, because this practice seems to them to be the truest training for war.
καὶ γὰρ πρῲ ἀνίστασθαι ἐθίζει καὶ ψύχη καὶ θάλπη ἀνέχεσθαι , γυμνάζει δὲ καὶ ὁδοιπορίαις καὶ δρόμοις , ἀνάγκη δὲ καὶ τοξεῦσαι θηρίον καὶ ἀκοντίσαι ὅπου ἂν παραπίπτῃ .	For it accustoms them to rise early in the morning and to endure both heat and cold , and it gives them practice in taking long tramps and runs , and they have to shoot or spear a wild beast whenever it comes in their way .	248	For it accustoms one to rise early and endure both cold and heat, and it also trains one through journeys and running, and there is a need to shoot at wild beasts and to hurl javelins wherever they may fall.
καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν δὲ πολλάκις ἀνάγκη θήγεσθαι ὅταν τι τῶν ἀλκίμων θηρίων ἀνθιστῆται : παίειν μὲν γὰρ δήπου δεῖ τὸ ὁμόσε γιγνόμενον , φυλάξασθαι δὲ τὸ ἐπιφερόμενον : ὥστε οὐ ῥᾴδιον εὑρεῖν τί ἐν τῇ θήρᾳ ἄπεστι τῶν ἐν πολέμῳ παρόντων .	And they must often whet their courage when one of the fierce beasts shows fight ; for , of course , they must strike down the animal that comes to close quarters with them , and they must be on their guard against the one that threatens to attack them . In a word , it is not easy to find any quality required in war that is not required also in the chase .	249	And often it is necessary to sharpen the spirit when some fierce beast resists: for indeed one must strike that which approaches and guard against that which bears down; so it is not easy to find what in the hunt is absent of the things present in war.
φύσιν μὲν δὴ τῆς μορφῆς καὶ τῆς ψυχῆς τοιαύτην ἔχων διαμνημονεύεται : ἐπαιδεύθη γε μὴν ἐν Περσῶν νόμοις : οὗτοι δὲ δοκοῦσιν οἱ νόμοι ἄρχεσθαι τοῦ κοινοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ἐπιμελούμενοι οὐκ ἔνθενπερ ἐν ταῖς πλείσταις πόλεσιν ἄρχονται .	Such then were the natural endowments , physical and spiritual , that he is reputed to have had ; but he was educated in conformity with the laws of the Persians ; and these laws appear in their care for the common weal not to start from the same point as they do in most states .	250	Having such a nature of form and soul, he is remembered: he was educated indeed in the laws of the Persians, and these laws seem to begin by taking care of the common good, not as in most cities.
αἱ μὲν γὰρ πλεῖσται πόλεις ἀφεῖσαι παιδεύειν ὅπως τις ἐθέλει τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ παῖδας , καὶ αὐτοὺς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ὅπως ἐθέλουσι διάγειν , ἔπειτα προστάττουσιν αὐτοῖς μὴ κλέπτειν μηδὲ ἁρπάζειν , μὴ βίᾳ εἰς οἰκίαν παριέναι , μὴ παίειν ὃν μὴ δίκαιον , μὴ μοιχεύειν , μὴ ἀπειθεῖν ἄρχοντι , καὶ τἆλλα τὰ τοιαῦτα ὡσαύτως : ἢν δέ τις τούτων τι παραβαίνῃ , ζημίαν αὐτοῖς ἐπέθεσαν .	For most states permit every one to train his own children just as he will , and the older people themselves to live as they please ; and then they command them not to steal and not to rob , not to break into anybody ' s house , not to strike a person whom they have no right to strike , not to commit adultery , not to disobey an officer , and so forth ; and if a man transgress anyone one of these laws , they punish him .	251	For most cities have let each one educate their own children as they wish, and the older men also to live as they wish, then they command them not to steal or rob, not to enter a house by force, not to strike anyone unjustly, not to commit adultery, not to disobey the authorities
οἱ δὲ Περσικοὶ νόμοι προλαβόντες ἐπιμέλονται ὅπως τὴν ἀρχὴν μὴ τοιοῦτοι ἔσονται οἱ πολῖται οἷοι πονηροῦ τινος ἢ αἰσχροῦ ἔργου ἐφίεσθαι . ἐπιμέλονται δὲ ὧδε . ἔστιν αὐτοῖς ἐλευθέρα ἀγορὰ καλουμένη , ἔνθα τά τε βασίλεια καὶ τἆλλα ἀρχεῖα πεποίηται .	"The Persian laws , however , begin at the beginning and take care that from the first their citizens shall not be of such a character as ever to desire anything improper or immoral ; and the measures they take are as follows . They have their so-called "" Free Square , "" where the royal palace and other government buildings are located ."	252	The Persian laws, having foreseen this, take care that from the beginning the citizens shall not be such as to engage in any wicked or shameful deed. They take care of this in the following way. They have a place called the free market, where both the royal buildings and the other public buildings have been made
ἐντεῦθεν τὰ μὲν ὤνια καὶ οἱ ἀγοραῖοι καὶ αἱ τούτων φωναὶ καὶ ἀπειροκαλίαι ἀπελήλανται εἰς ἄλλον τόπον , ὡς μὴ μιγνύηται ἡ τούτων τύρβη τῇ τῶν πεπαιδευμένων εὐκοσμίᾳ .	The hucksters with their wares , their cries , and their vulgarities are excluded from this and relegated to another part of the city , in order that their tumult may not intrude upon the orderly life of the cultured .	253	Hence, the wares, the market people, and their cries and vulgarities have been driven to another place, so that their tumult does not blend with the orderly conduct of the educated.
διῄρηται δὲ αὕτη ἡ ἀγορὰ ἡ περὶ τὰ ἀρχεῖα τέτταρα μέρη : τούτων δ᾽ ἔστιν ἓν μὲν παισίν , ἓν δὲ ἐφήβοις , ἄλλο τελείοις ἀνδράσιν , ἄλλο τοῖς ὑπὲρ τὰ στρατεύσιμα ἔτη γεγονόσι .	This square , enclosing the government buildings , is divided into four parts ; one of these belongs to the boys , one to the youths , another to the men of mature years , and another to those who are past the age for military service .	254	This market near the archives is divided into four parts: one for children, one for youths, another for mature men, and another for those beyond the military age.
νόμῳ δ᾽ εἰς τὰς ἑαυτῶν χώρας ἕκαστοι τούτων πάρεισιν , οἱ μὲν παῖδες ἅμα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ καὶ οἱ τέλειοι ἄνδρες , οἱ δὲ γεραίτεροι ἡνίκ᾽ ἂν ἑκάστῳ προχωρῇ , πλὴν ἐν ταῖς τεταγμέναις ἡμέραις , ἐν αἷς αὐτοὺς δεῖ παρεῖναι .	And the laws require them to come daily to their several quarters — the boys and the full-grown men at daybreak ; but the elders may come at whatever time it suits each one ' s convenience , except that they must present themselves on certain specified days .	255	By law, each of these goes to their own regions, the children during the day and the mature men, and the elders whenever it is convenient for each of them, except on the appointed days when they must be present.
οἱ δὲ ἔφηβοι καὶ κοιμῶνται περὶ τὰ ἀρχεῖα σὺν τοῖς γυμνητικοῖς ὅπλοις πλὴν τῶν γεγαμηκότων : οὗτοι δὲ οὔτε ἐπιζητοῦνται , ἢν μὴ προρρηθῇ παρεῖναι , οὔτε πολλάκις ἀπεῖναι καλόν .	But the youths pass the night also in light armour about the government buildings — all except those who are married ; no inquiry is made for such , unless they be especially ordered in advance to be there , but it is not proper for them to be absent too often .	256	The adolescents sleep around the public buildings with their gymnastic equipment except for those who are married: these are neither sought after, unless it is specifically proclaimed for them to be present, nor is it often good for them to be absent.
ἄρχοντες δ᾽ ἐφ᾽ ἑκάστῳ τούτων τῶν μερῶν εἰσι δώδεκα : δώδεκα γὰρ καὶ Περσῶν φυλαὶ διῄρηνται .	Over each of these divisions there are twelve officers , for the Persians are divided into twelve tribes .	257	Over each of these divisions there are twelve rulers, for the tribes of the Persians are also divided into twelve.
καὶ ἐπὶ μὲν τοῖς παισὶν ἐκ τῶν γεραιτέρων ᾑρημένοι εἰσὶν οἳ ἂν δοκῶσι τοὺς παῖδας βελτίστους ἀποδεικνύναι : ἐπὶ δὲ τοῖς ἐφήβοις ἐκ τῶν τελείων ἀνδρῶν οἳ ἂν αὖ τοὺς ἐφήβους βελτίστους δοκῶσι παρέχειν : ἐπὶ δὲ τοῖς τελείοις ἀνδράσιν οἳ ἂν δοκῶσι παρέχειν αὐτοὺς μάλιστα τὰ τεταγμένα ποιοῦντας καὶ τὰ παραγγελλόμενα ὑπὸ τῆς μεγίστης ἀρχῆς : εἰσὶ δὲ καὶ τῶν γεραιτέρων προστάται ᾑρημένοι , οἳ προστατεύουσιν ὅπως καὶ οὗτοι τὰ καθήκοντα ἀποτελῶσιν .	To have charge of the boys , such are chosen from the ranks of the elders as seem likely to make out of the boys the best men ; to have charge of the youths , such are chosen from the ranks of the mature men as seem most likely on their part to develop the youths best ; to preside over the mature men , those are selected who seem most likely to fit them best to execute the orders and requirements of the highest authorities ; and of the elders also chiefs are selected who act as overseers to see that those of this class also do their duty .	258	And for the children, those chosen from the older ones are those who seem to show the best children; for the youths, those chosen from the full-grown men who seem to provide the best youths; and for the full-grown men, those who seem to ensure that they perform the duties assigned to them and the instructions given
ἃ δὲ ἑκάστῃ ἡλικίᾳ προστέτακται ποιεῖν διηγησόμεθα , ὡς μᾶλλον δῆλον γένηται ᾗ ἐπιμέλονται ὡς ἂν βέλτιστοι εἶεν οἱ πολῖται .	And what duties are assigned to each age to perform we shall now set forth , that it may be better understood what pains the Persians take that their citizens may prove to be the very best .	259	We shall narrate what is assigned for each age to do, so that it becomes clearer how they are cared for to be the best citizens.
οἱ μὲν δὴ παῖδες εἰς τὰ διδασκαλεῖα φοιτῶντες διάγουσι μανθάνοντες δικαιοσύνην : καὶ λέγουσιν ὅτι ἐπὶ τοῦτο ἔρχονται ὥσπερ παρ᾽ ἡμῖν ὅτι γράμματα μαθησόμενοι .	The boys go to school and spend their time in learning justice ; and they say that they go there for this purpose , just as in our country they say that they go to learn to read and write .	260	The boys indeed go to the schools and spend their time learning justice; and they say that they come for this purpose just as among us they come to learn letters.
οἱ δ᾽ ἄρχοντες αὐτῶν διατελοῦσι τὸ πλεῖστον τῆς ἡμέρας δικάζοντες αὐτοῖς .	And their officers spend the greater part of the day in deciding cases for them .	261	Their rulers spend most of the day judging them.
γίγνεται γὰρ δὴ καὶ παισὶ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ὥσπερ ἀνδράσιν ἐγκλήματα καὶ κλοπῆς καὶ ἁρπαγῆς καὶ βίας καὶ ἀπάτης καὶ κακολογίας καὶ ἄλλων οἵων δὴ εἰκός . οὓς δ᾽ ἂν γνῶσι τούτων τι ἀδικοῦντας , τιμωροῦνται .	For , as a matter of course , boys also prefer charges against one another , just as men do , of theft , robbery , assault , cheating , slander , and other things that naturally come up ; and when they discover any one committing any of these crimes , they punish him ,	262	For indeed even among children there arise charges against one another of theft and robbery and violence and deceit and slander and all such things as are likely. And when they find anyone guilty of doing these things, they punish them.
κολάζουσι δὲ καὶ ὃν ἂν ἀδίκως ἐγκαλοῦντα εὑρίσκωσι .	and they punish also any one whom they find accusing another falsely .	263	They also punish anyone they find making an unjust accusation.
δικάζουσι δὲ καὶ ἐγκλήματος οὗ ἕνεκα ἄνθρωποι μισοῦσι μὲν ἀλλήλους μάλιστα , δικάζονται δὲ ἥκιστα , ἀχαριστίας , καὶ ὃν ἂν γνῶσι δυνάμενον μὲν χάριν ἀποδιδόναι , μὴ ἀποδιδόντα δέ , κολάζουσι καὶ τοῦτον ἰσχυρῶς .	And they bring one another to trial also charged with an offence for which people hate one another most but go to law least , namely , that of ingratitude ; and if they know that any one is able to return a favour and fails to do so , they punish him also severely .	264	They also give judgment for a crime for which people especially hate each other but judge the least, ingratitude; and whoever they discover able to return a favor but not doing so, they severely punish.
οἴονται γὰρ τοὺς ἀχαρίστους καὶ περὶ θεοὺς ἂν μάλιστα ἀμελῶς ἔχειν καὶ περὶ γονέας καὶ πατρίδα καὶ φίλους . ἕπεσθαι δὲ δοκεῖ μάλιστα τῇ ἀχαριστίᾳ ἡ ἀναισχυντία : καὶ γὰρ αὕτη μεγίστη δοκεῖ εἶναι ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ αἰσχρὰ ἡγεμών .	For they think that the ungrateful are likely to be most neglectful of their duty toward their gods , their parents , their country , and their friends ; for it seems that shamelessness goes hand in hand with ingratitude ; and it is that , we know , which leads the way to every moral wrong .	265	For they think that the ungrateful would be especially negligent concerning the gods, as well as concerning parents, country, and friends. Shamelessness seems to follow ungratefulness most closely: for it appears to be the greatest leader towards all shameful acts.
διδάσκουσι δὲ τοὺς παῖδας καὶ σωφροσύνην : μέγα δὲ συμβάλλεται εἰς τὸ μανθάνειν σωφρονεῖν αὐτοὺς ὅτι καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ὁρῶσιν ἀνὰ πᾶσαν ἡμέραν σωφρόνως διάγοντας .	They teach the boys self-control also ; and it greatly conduces to their learning self-control that they see their elders also living temperately day by day .	266	They also teach the children moderation: and it greatly contributes to their learning moderation that they see the elders every day conducting themselves with moderation.
διδάσκουσι δὲ αὐτοὺς καὶ πείθεσθαι τοῖς ἄρχουσι : μέγα δὲ καὶ εἰς τοῦτο συμβάλλεται ὅτι ὁρῶσι τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους πειθομένους τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ἰσχυρῶς .	And they teach them likewise to obey the officers ; and it greatly conduces to this also that they see their elders implicitly obeying their officers .	267	They teach them to obey the rulers; it also greatly contributes to this that they see the elders strongly obeying the rulers.
διδάσκουσι δὲ καὶ ἐγκράτειαν γαστρὸς καὶ ποτοῦ : μέγα δὲ καὶ εἰς τοῦτο συμβάλλεται ὅτι ὁρῶσι τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους οὐ πρόσθεν ἀπιόντας γαστρὸς ἕνεκα πρὶν ἂν ἀφῶσιν οἱ ἄρχοντες , καὶ ὅτι οὐ παρὰ μητρὶ σιτοῦνται οἱ παῖδες , ἀλλὰ παρὰ τῷ διδασκάλῳ , ὅταν οἱ ἄρχοντες σημήνωσι .	And besides , they teach them self-restraint in eating and drinking ; and it greatly conduces to this also that they see that their elders do not leave their post to satisfy their hunger until the officers dismiss them ; and the same end is promoted by the fact that the boys do not eat with their mothers but with their teachers , from the time the officers so direct .	268	They also teach self-control of the stomach and drink; and a great contribution to this is that they see the elders do not leave because of hunger before the rulers dismiss them, and that the children do not eat with their mother, but with the teacher when the rulers signal.
φέρονται δὲ οἴκοθεν σῖτον μὲν ἄρτον , ὄψον δὲ κάρδαμον , πιεῖν δέ , ἤν τις διψῇ , κώθωνα , ὡς ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἀρύσασθαι .	Furthermore , they bring from home bread for their food , cress for a relish , and for drinking , if any one is thirsty , a cup to draw water from the river .	269	They carry from home bread as food, watercress as relish, and to drink, if anyone is thirsty, a cup to draw from the river.
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις μανθάνουσι καὶ τοξεύειν καὶ ἀκοντίζειν .	Besides this , they learn to shoot and to throw the spear .	270	In addition to these things, they learn to shoot with a bow and to throw a javelin.
μέχρι μὲν δὴ ἓξ ἢ ἑπτακαίδεκα ἐτῶν ἀπὸ γενεᾶς οἱ παῖδες ταῦτα πράττουσιν , ἐκ τούτου δὲ εἰς τοὺς ἐφήβους ἐξέρχονται .	This , then , is what the boys do until they are sixteen or seventeen years of age , and after this they are promoted from the class of boys and enrolled among the young men .	271	Until the age of sixteen or seventeen from birth, the children do these things, and from then on they enter into youth.
οὗτοι δ᾽ αὖ οἱ ἔφηβοι διάγουσιν ὧδε . δέκα ἔτη ἀφ᾽ οὗ ἂν ἐκ παίδων ἐξέλθωσι κοιμῶνται μὲν περὶ τὰ ἀρχεῖα , ὥσπερ προειρήκαμεν , καὶ φυλακῆς ἕνεκα τῆς πόλεως καὶ σωφροσύνης : δοκεῖ γὰρ αὕτη ἡ ἡλικία μάλιστα ἐπιμελείας δεῖσθαι : παρέχουσι δὲ καὶ τὴν ἡμέραν ἑαυτοὺς τοῖς ἄρχουσι χρῆσθαι ἤν τι δέωνται ὑπὲρ τοῦ κοινοῦ .	Now the young men in their turn live as follows : for ten years after they are promoted from the class of boys they pass the nights , as we said before , about the government buildings . This they do for the sake of guarding the city and of developing their powers of self-control ; for this time of life , it seems , demands the most watchful care . And during the day , too , they put themselves at the disposal of the authorities , if they are needed for any service to the state .	272	But these young men spend their time in this way: for ten years after they leave boyhood, they sleep around the public offices, as we have previously stated, both for the protection of the city and for their own discipline. For it is thought that this age especially requires supervision. They also make themselves available to the
καὶ ὅταν μὲν δέῃ , πάντες μένουσι περὶ τὰ ἀρχεῖα : ὅταν δὲ ἐξίῃ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ θήραν , ἐξάγει τὴν ἡμίσειαν τῆς φυλακῆς : ποιεῖ δὲ τοῦτο πολλάκις τοῦ μηνός .	Whenever it is necessary , they all remain about the public buildings . But when the king goes out hunting , he takes out half the garrison ; and this he does many times a month .	273	And whenever it is necessary, all stay around the archives: but whenever the king goes out for hunting, he takes half of the guard with him: and he does this many times a month.
ἔχειν δὲ δεῖ τοὺς ἐξιόντας τόξα καὶ παρὰ τὴν φαρέτραν ἐν κολεῷ κοπίδα ἢ σάγαριν , ἔτι δὲ γέρρον καὶ παλτὰ δύο , ὥστε τὸ μὲν ἀφεῖναι , τῷ δ᾽ , ἂν δέῃ , ἐκ χειρὸς χρῆσθαι .	Those who go must take bow and arrows and , in addition to the quiver , a sabre or bill in its scabbard ; they carry along also a light shield and two spears , on to throw , the other to use in case of necessity in a hand-to-hand encounter .	274	But those departing must have bows and, besides the quiver, a sword in a scabbard or a battle-axe, and also a wicker shield and two javelins, so that one can be thrown and the other, if necessary, used in hand-to-hand combat.
