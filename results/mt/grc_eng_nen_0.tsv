οὔ τ᾽ ἄρ ὅ γ᾽ εὐχωλῆς ἐπιμέμφεται οὐ δ᾽ ἑκατόμβης , ἀλλ᾽ ἕνεκ᾽ ἀρητῆρος ὃν ἠτίμησ᾽ Ἀγαμέμνων , οὐ δ᾽ ἀπέλυσε θύγατρα καὶ οὐκ ἀπεδέξατ᾽ ἄποινα , τοὔνεκ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἄλγε᾽ ἔδωκεν ἑκηβόλος ἠδ᾽ ἔτι δώσει :	It is not then because of a vow that he finds fault , nor because of a hecatomb , but because of the priest whom Agamemnon dishonoured , and did not release his daughter nor accept the ransom . For this cause the god who strikes from afar has given woes and will still give them .	46	He neither blames the vow nor the hecatomb, but because Agamemnon dishonored the priest whom he did not release his daughter and did not accept the ransom; for this reason, the far-shooter gave pains and will still give more.	He does not blame the vow or the hecatomb, but because of the priest whom Agamemnon dishonored and did not release his daughter and did not accept the ransom, therefore the far-shooter gave grief and will still give it.	Neither does he blame the prayer, nor the sacrifice, but for the sake of the cursed one whom Agamemnon dishonored, for he did not release his daughter and did not accept the ransom, therefore indeed he has inflicted pain and will still give more.	No one blames him for the prayer, nor for the hundred oxen, but because he dishonoured the herald whom Agamemnon honoured, and did not release his daughter and did not accept the ransom, for this reason he gave him pain and will still give him pain.
οὐ δ᾽ ὅ γε πρὶν Δαναοῖσιν ἀεικέα λοιγὸν ἀπώσει πρίν γ᾽ ἀπὸ πατρὶ φίλῳ δόμεναι ἑλικώπιδα κούρην ἀπριάτην ἀνάποινον , ἄγειν θ᾽ ἱερὴν ἑκατόμβην ἐς Χρύσην :	He will not drive off from the Danaans the loathsome pestilence , until we give back to her dear father the bright-eyed maiden , unbought , unransomed , and lead a sacred hecatomb to Chryse .	47	But he will not ward off shameful destruction from the Danaans until a glancing-eyed girl, without ransom and unrewarded, is given back to her dear father, and a sacred hecatomb is brought to Chryse.	But he would not drive the foul pestilence from the Danaans until they gave to his father the bright-eyed maiden, unransomed and unyielding, and carried a sacred hecatomb to Chryse.	"""But he would not send away the shameful plague for the Danaans before giving the beloved daughter to his dear father, nor would he lead the sacred hundredfold sacrifice to Chryses."""	He would not, however, have been guilty of a foul deed before the Danai, before he gave to his dear father the maiden with the lovely eyes, the unharmed, the unseizable, to lead a hundred-ox sacrifice to Chryse.
τότε κέν μιν ἱλασσάμενοι πεπίθοιμεν .	Then we might appease and persuade him .	48	then we could have persuaded him by appeasing him.	then we might persuade him by appeasing him.	Then, having softened me, we would persuade.	Then shall we have despised him and encouraged him.

Then the hero, Atreus' son, wide-ruling Agamemnon, stood up, grieving.	Then the hero Atreides, wide-ruling Agamemnon, arose, grieving.	But Agamemnon, the broad-shouldered, mighty son of Atreus, rose up, sorrowing.
μένεος δὲ μέγα φρένες ἀμφιμέλαιναι πίμπλαντ᾽ , ὄσσε δέ οἱ πυρὶ λαμπετόωντι ἐΐκτην :	With rage his black heart was wholly filled , and his eyes were like blazing fire .	51	"""And his dark mind was filled with fury, and his eyes resembled blazing fire."""	His great black heart was filled with rage, and his eyes shone like blazing fire.	But great anger filled his heart, and his eyes glowed like fire.

First of all, with a wretched voice, he spoke.
μάντι κακῶν οὐ πώ ποτέ μοι τὸ κρήγυον εἶπας :	Prophet of evil , never yet have you spoken to me a pleasant thing ;	53	Soothsayer of ill, you have never yet told me anything good.	Never yet, O prophet of evil, hast thou spoken a word that was not ill-omened.	You have never told me the remedy for evils.	You have never told me the truth about evil.
αἰεί τοι τὰ κάκ᾽ ἐστὶ φίλα φρεσὶ μαντεύεσθαι , ἐσθλὸν δ᾽ οὔτέ τί πω εἶπας ἔπος οὔ τ᾽ ἐτέλεσσας :	ever is evil dear to your heart to prophesy , but a word of good you have never yet spoken , nor brought to pass .	54	Always to thee do the evil things seem dear to prophesy, and never yet hast thou spoken a good word or accomplished one.

And now among the Danaans you claim to speak as a prophet, saying that for this reason the far-shooter brings grief upon them, because I was unwilling to accept the glorious ransom for the girl Chryseis, since I wish to have her in my house;	And now among the Danaans you speak as an oracle that indeed for this reason the Far-Shooting one brings forth pains for them, because I did not wish to accept the splendid ransom of the daughter of Chryses, since I greatly desire to keep her at home.	And now among the Danai you are speaking as a prophet of the gods, saying that you, the swift-footed one, are causing suffering for them because I, a girl, did not want to accept the ransom for Chryseis, because I very much want her to stay at home.
καὶ γάρ ῥα Κλυταιμνήστρης προβέβουλα κουριδίης ἀλόχου , ἐπεὶ οὔ ἑθέν ἐστι χερείων , οὐ δέμας οὐ δὲ φυήν , οὔ τ᾽ ἂρ φρένας οὔτέ τι ἔργα .	For certainly I prefer her to Clytemnestra , my wedded wife , since she is not inferior to her , either in form or in stature , or in mind , or in any handiwork .	56	For truly I prefer Clytemnestra to my wedded wife, since she in no way is inferior, neither in form nor in stature, neither in mind nor in deeds.	For she stands out among the women of Clytaemnestra, since she is not inferior in any way, neither in build nor in stature, nor in mind nor in work.	And indeed, I have preferred the daughter of Clytemnestra as a worthy wife, since there is none from here who is inferior, neither in form nor in stature, nor in intellect, nor in any deeds.	And forsooth, Clytemnestra, a prudent and cunning wife, for she had no beauty, nor any wealth, nor any noble birth, nor any virtues.
ἀλλὰ καὶ ὧς ἐθέλω δόμεναι πάλιν εἰ τό γ᾽ ἄμεινον :	Yet even so will I give her back , if that is better ;	57	But even so, I am willing to give again if indeed it is better.	but even so I am willing to give it back if that is best:	But also as I wish to give again if it is better.

But we have exhausted the cities, the countryside has been ravaged, and it is not fitting for the people to be stirred up in this way.

Two generations of mortal men had already passed away in his lifetime, those who were born and brought up with him in sacred Pylos, and he was king over the third.	"""But already two generations of mortal men had perished, those who had been nurtured together before and had been born in noble Pylos, and then a third one ruled:"""	Two generations of men had already passed, who had been nourished by him and had been born in the noble city of Pylos.
ὅ σφιν ἐὺ φρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν :	He with good intent addressed the gathering and spoke among them :	140	He, with good intentions, spoke and addressed them:	who with good intent addressed them and spoke :	He, being wise in thought, spoke and addressed them.	They who were of good mind bought and recited it.
ὦ πόποι ἦ μέγα πένθος Ἀχαιΐδα γαῖαν ἱκάνει :	Comrades , great grief has come upon the land of Achaea .	141	Oh alas, great grief reaches the land of Achaea.	Oh dear, a great sorrow is coming to the land of Achaea.	Oh, what a great sorrow has come upon the land of the Achaeans!	Oh woe is me, great grief comes to the land of Achaea.
ἦ κεν γηθήσαι Πρίαμος Πριάμοιό τε παῖδες ἄλλοι τε Τρῶες μέγα κεν κεχαροίατο θυμῷ εἰ σφῶϊν τάδε πάντα πυθοίατο μαρναμένοιϊν , οἳ περὶ μὲν βουλὴν Δαναῶν , περὶ δ᾽ ἐστὲ μάχεσθαι .	Truly would Priam and the sons of Priam rejoice , and the rest of the Trojans would be most glad at heart , were they to hear all this of you two quarrelling , you who are chief among the Danaans in counsel and chief in war .	142	Priam and the sons of Priam, and the other Trojans would be glad, greatly would they rejoice in their hearts if they learned of you two fighting, who are among the best in the council of the Danaans and in fighting.	Surely would Priam and the sons of Priam and the other Trojans be glad at heart, if they could hear you two wrangling, you, who are their best men in counsel and in fight.	Then Priam would surely rejoice, both he and his other sons, and the great Trojans would be delighted in their hearts if they learned all these things about you two fighting, those who are deliberating about the Achaeans and about the battle.	"Here is the translation:

But Priam would have been filled with grief, and Priam's sons and the other Trojans would have been greatly distressed in their hearts, if they had known that they would have to endure all this while fighting for their own lives, who were either advising the Danaans or fighting."
ἀλλὰ πίθεσθ᾽ :	Listen to me ,	143	But obey	but obey:	But trust (or believe).	But trust:
ἄμφω δὲ νεωτέρω ἐστὸν ἐμεῖο :	for you are both younger than I .	144	Both of them are younger than I.	Both are younger than I am.	Both are indeed younger than me.	Both are younger than me.
ἤδη γάρ ποτ᾽ ἐγὼ καὶ ἀρείοσιν ἠέ περ ὑμῖν ἀνδράσιν ὡμίλησα , καὶ οὔ ποτέ μ᾽ οἵ γ᾽ ἀθέριζον .	In earlier times I moved among men more warlike than you , and never did they despise me .	145	For I have already associated with men better than you, and they never disregarded me.	For I have already at some time consorted with men braver than you, and they never scorned me.	For I have already conversed at times with the nobler men among you, and those who were unworthy never slighted me.	Already I have spoken to men better than you, and never have they insulted me.
οὐ γάρ πω τοίους ἴδον ἀνέρας οὐ δὲ ἴδωμαι , οἷον Πειρίθοόν τε Δρύαντά τε ποιμένα λαῶν Καινέα τ᾽ Ἐξάδιόν τε καὶ ἀντίθεον Πολύφημον Θησέα τ᾽ Αἰγεΐδην , ἐπιείκελον ἀθανάτοισιν :	Such warriors have I never since seen , nor shall I see , as Peirithous was and Dryas , shepherd of the people , and Caeneus and Exadius and godlike Polyphemus , and Theseus , son of Aegeus , a man like the immortals .	146	For I have never yet seen such men, nor shall I see them, as Pirithous and Dryas the shepherd of the people and Caeneus and Exadius and godlike Polyphemus and Theseus son of Aegeus, all equal to the immortals.	For I have never yet seen such men, nor shall I see them, as were Peirithous and Dryas, shepherd of the people, and Caeneus and Exadius and godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus, son of Aegeus, like to the immortals.	For I have never seen such men, nor shall I see them, like Peirithous and Dryas, shepherd of the people, and Kainas and Exadius, and the godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus, the son of Aegeus, resembling the immortals.	I have never seen such men, nor do I see them, men like Pirithous and Dryas, the shepherd of the people, Caeus and Exadius, and the opposite Polyphemus, Theseus and Aegeus, gracious to the immortals.
κάρτιστοι δὴ κεῖνοι ἐπιχθονίων τράφεν ἀνδρῶν :	Mightiest were these of men reared upon the earth ;	147	Dearest indeed of all the men on earth reared:	Those men were the most chivalrous of all the men that walk on the earth :	Those who were most excellent among the men of the earth.	Those, therefore, of mortal men are nourished.
κάρτιστοι μὲν ἔσαν καὶ καρτίστοις ἐμάχοντο φηρσὶν ὀρεσκῴοισι καὶ ἐκπάγλως ἀπόλεσσαν .	mightiest were they , and with the mightiest they fought , the mountain-dwelling centaurs , and they destroyed them terribly .	148	They were very strong and fought against very strong mountain beasts and completely destroyed them.	They were very strong and fought against the strongest beasts of the mountains and killed them off amazingly.	They were the strongest and fought fiercely against the mountain-dwelling beasts and were utterly destroyed.	Fierce warriors, they were, and fought fiercely, as they said, with reckless abandon.
ὡς ἔγωγε καὶ ὑπὲρ σοῦ καὶ ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν τῶν σῶν ἐπιτηδείων αἰσχύνομαι μὴ δόξῃ ἅπαν τὸ πρᾶγμα τὸ περὶ σὲ ἀνανδρίᾳ τινὶ τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ πεπρᾶχθαι , καὶ ἡ εἴσοδος τῆς δίκης εἰς τὸ δικαστήριον ὡς εἰσῆλθεν ἐξὸν μὴ εἰσελθεῖν , καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ ἀγὼν τῆς δίκης ὡς ἐγένετο , καὶ τὸ τελευταῖον δὴ τουτί , ὥσπερ κατάγελως τῆς πράξεως , κακίᾳ τινὶ καὶ ἀνανδρίᾳ τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ διαπεφευγέναι ἡμᾶς δοκεῖν , οἵτινές σε οὐχὶ ἐσώσαμεν οὐδὲ σὺ σαυτόν , οἷόν τε ὂν καὶ δυνατὸν εἴ τι καὶ μικρὸν ἡμῶν ὄφελος ἦν .	So I am shamed both for you and for us , your friends , and I am afraid people will think that this whole affair of yours has been conducted with a sort of cowardice on our part — both the fact that the case came before the court , when it might have been avoided , and the way in which the trial itself was carried on , and finally they will think , as the crowning absurdity of the whole affair , that this opportunity has escaped us through some base cowardice on our part , since we did not save you , and you did not save yourself , though it was quite possible if we had been of any use whatever .	149	For I, at least, am ashamed on your behalf and on behalf of us, your friends, that the whole matter concerning you might seem to have been done because of some cowardice of ours, and that the trial was brought into the court when it could have not been, and that the whole conduct of the trial	For I am ashamed, both for you and for us, your friends, that the whole affair concerning you should seem to have been managed with a certain lack of manliness on our part, and the bringing of the suit to court, as it was brought, when it was possible not to bring it, and the very	As for me, I am ashamed that all the matters concerning you may appear to have been carried out with some cowardice on our part, both for you and for our own interests. And the entrance of the lawsuit into the court, as it happened, was such that it should not have been admitted, and the very	As I do, and for your sake, and for the sake of those who are concerned with you, I am ashamed that the whole affair concerning you was not handled with courage, and that the entrance into the court was not allowed to enter, and the trial itself was not conducted, and finally, this, as it
ταῦτα οὖν , ὦ Σώκρατες , ὅρα μὴ ἅμα τῷ κακῷ καὶ αἰσχρὰ ᾖ σοί τε καὶ ἡμῖν .	Take care , Socrates , that these things be not disgraceful , as well as evil , both to you and to us .	150	Therefore, Socrates, see that these things do not bring shame and harm both to you and to us.	Consider then, Socrates, whether nobleness and baseness is not in this, or is wholly in something else.	Therefore, O Socrates, take care that it may not be both bad and shameful for you and for us.	These things then, Socrates, see that they are not at the same time bad and shameful for you and for us.
ἀλλὰ βουλεύου — μᾶλλον δὲ οὐδὲ βουλεύεσθαι ἔτι ὥρα ἀλλὰ βεβουλεῦσθαι — μία δὲ βουλή : τῆς γὰρ ἐπιούσης νυκτὸς πάντα ταῦτα δεῖ πεπρᾶχθαι , εἰ δ᾽ ἔτι περιμενοῦμεν , ἀδύνατον καὶ οὐκέτι οἷόν τε .	Just consider , or rather it is time not to consider any longer , but to have finished considering . And there is just one possible plan ; for all this must be done in the coming night . And if we delay it can no longer be done .	151	But deliberate — or rather, it is no longer time to deliberate, but to have already deliberated — one plan: for all these things must be done by the coming night, and if we delay any longer, it is impossible and no longer feasible.	But deliberate—no, rather it is no longer time for deliberation, but for having deliberated—there is only one plan: for all these things must be done in the coming night, but if we wait any longer, it is impossible and no longer feasible.	But deliberate — rather, it is no longer the time to deliberate, but to have deliberated — for there is one plan: for all these things must be accomplished by the coming night, and if we wait any longer, it will be impossible and no longer feasible.	But deliberate — nay, it is not even time to deliberate, but to have deliberated — one decision: for all this must be done by nightfall, if we wait any longer, it will be impossible and no longer possible.
ἀλλὰ παντὶ τρόπῳ , ὦ Σώκρατες , πείθου μοι καὶ μηδαμῶς ἄλλως ποίει .	But I beg you , Socrates , do as I say and don ' t refuse .	152	But in every way, Socrates, obey me and do not act otherwise.	But in every way, Socrates, be persuaded by me and do not do otherwise.	But in every way, O Socrates, convince me and do not act otherwise at all.	But in any case, Socrates, persuade me and do not act otherwise.
Σωκράτης . τί τηνικάδε ἀφῖξαι , ὦ Κρίτων ; ἢ οὐ πρῲ ἔτι ἐστίν ;	Socrates . Why have you come at this time , Crito ? Or isn ' t it still early ?	153	Socrates: Why have you come at this hour, Crito? Is it not still early?	Socrates . Why have you come at this hour, Crito? it must be quite early?	Socrates: Why have you come here, Crito? Is it not still very early?	Socrates. What are you about, Kriton? Or is it not yet time?
Κρίτων . πάνυ μὲν οὖν .	Crito . Yes , very early .	154	Crito: Certainly.	Crito . Very much so .	Crito. Indeed, then.	Crito. Very well.
Σωκράτης . πηνίκα μάλιστα ;	Socrates . About what time ?	155	Socrates. How are you most?	Socrates . When is that ?	Socrates. When, especially?	Socrates, are you quite well?
Κρίτων . ὄρθρος βαθύς .	Crito . Just before dawn .	156	Crito. It is deep dawn.	Crito. Deep dawn.	Crito. Deep dawn.	Socrates. Deep morning.
Σωκράτης . θαυμάζω ὅπως ἠθέλησέ σοι ὁ τοῦ δεσμωτηρίου φύλαξ ὑπακοῦσαι .	Socrates . I am surprised that the watchman of the prison was willing to let you in .	157	Socrates: I marvel at how the jailer chose to obey you.	Socrates . I am surprised that the keeper of the prison was willing to obey you .	Socrates: I wonder how the guard of the prison was willing to obey you.	Socrates. I am amazed at how the jailer's guard wished you to obey.
Κρίτων . συνήθης ἤδη μοί ἐστιν , ὦ Σώκρατες , διὰ τὸ πολλάκις δεῦρο φοιτᾶν , καί τι καὶ εὐεργέτηται ὑπ᾽ ἐμοῦ .	Crito . He is used to me by this time , Socrates , because I come here so often , and besides I have done something for him .	158	Crito: It is already familiar to me, Socrates, because of my frequent visits here, and he has also been somewhat benefited by me.	Crito. Already, Socrates, it is not my first time here, for I have visited many times, and I have also been benefited by you.	Crito: It is already customary for me, O Socrates, to come here often, and in a way, I am also benefited by you.	Crito. It is now a familiar thing to me, Socrates, because I have come here many times, and I have been benefited by me.
Σωκράτης . ἄρτι δὲ ἥκεις ἢ πάλαι ;	Socrates . Have you just come , or some time ago ?	159	Socrates: Have you just arrived or have you been here for a while?	Socrates . But have you arrived just now, or some time since?	Socrates: Have you just arrived or have you been here for a while?	Socrates. Have you just arrived or have you been here for a while?
Κρίτων . ἐπιεικῶς πάλαι .	Crito . Some little time ago .	160	Crito: Quite some time.	Crito . For some time past.	Criton. Very well, for a long time.	Crito. Moderately, long ago.
Σωκράτης . εἶτα πῶς οὐκ εὐθὺς ἐπήγειράς με , ἀλλὰ σιγῇ παρακάθησαι ; γ	Socrates . Then why did you not wake me at once , instead of sitting by me in silence ?	161	Socrates: Then why did you not wake me up at once, but sat beside me in silence?	Socrates . Then why did you not wake me at once , but sit in silence by my side ?	Socrates. Then how did you not immediately wake me up, but instead sat quietly by?	Socrates: Then why did you not immediately stir me up, but sit quietly by?
Κρίτων . οὐ μὰ τὸν Δία , ὦ Σώκρατες , οὐδ᾽ ἂν αὐτὸς ἤθελον ἐν τοσαύτῃ τε ἀγρυπνίᾳ καὶ λύπῃ εἶναι , ἀλλὰ καὶ σοῦ πάλαι θαυμάζω αἰσθανόμενος ὡς ἡδέως καθεύδεις : καὶ ἐπίτηδές σε οὐκ ἤγειρον ἵνα ὡς ἥδιστα διάγῃς .	Crito . No , no , by Zeus , Socrates , I only wish I myself were not so sleepless and sorrowful . But I have been wondering at you for some time , seeing how sweetly you sleep ; and I purposely refrained from waking you , that you might pass the time as pleasantly as possible .	162	Crito: By Zeus, Socrates, I myself would not want to be in such a state of sleeplessness and sorrow, but I have been wondering for a while at how pleasantly you sleep: and I intentionally did not wake you up so that you might have as pleasant a stay as possible.	Crito . By Zeus, Socrates, I would not have been willing to be in such great sleeplessness and grief myself, but I have long been marveling at you, perceiving how pleasantly you sleep; and I did not wake you on purpose, so that you might pass the time as pleasantly as possible.	Criton. By Zeus, O Socrates, I would not want to be in such great wakefulness and distress, and I have long admired you, noticing how sweetly you sleep; and I intentionally did not awaken you so that you might live as pleasantly as possible.	Crito. By the gods, Socrates, I wouldn't want to be in such a state of wakefulness and distress, even if I wanted to, but I've long admired how easily you sleep, and I've often failed to wake you so that you might enjoy yourself.
καὶ πολλάκις μὲν δή σε καὶ πρότερον ἐν παντὶ τῷ βίῳ ηὐδαιμόνισα τοῦ τρόπου , πολὺ δὲ μάλιστα ἐν τῇ νῦν παρεστώσῃ συμφορᾷ , ὡς ῥᾳδίως αὐτὴν καὶ πρᾴως φέρεις .	I have often thought throughout your life hitherto that you were of a happy disposition , and I think so more than ever in this resent misfortune , since you bear it so easily and calmly .	163	"""And many times indeed, even before, in all your life I have considered you fortunate for your character, but especially now in the present misfortune, for how easily and gently you endure it."""	And many times indeed I have congratulated you before on your way of life, but most of all in the present misfortune, on seeing how lightly and calmly you bear it.	And indeed, I have often blessed you throughout all your life in this manner, but especially now in the present misfortune, as you bear it so easily and calmly.	And often indeed you have been happy in every way in life, but especially in the present misfortune, as you easily and calmly bear it.
Σωκράτης . καὶ γὰρ ἄν , ὦ Κρίτων , πλημμελὲς εἴη ἀγανακτεῖν τηλικοῦτον ὄντα εἰ δεῖ ἤδη τελευτᾶν .	Socrates . Well , Crito , it would be absurd if at my age I were disturbed because I must die now .	164	Socrates: It would indeed be unreasonable, Crito, for someone of my age to be upset if it is time to die.	Socrates . For even if it were not, Crito, it would be wrong to be angry when I have to die now.	Socrates. For it would indeed be wrong, O Crito, to be indignant at such a thing when one must already die.	Socrates. For, indeed, it would be unseemly, O Crito, to be so upset, being as I am, to die now.
Κρίτων . καὶ ἄλλοι , ὦ Σώκρατες , τηλικοῦτοι ἐν τοιαύταις συμφοραῖς ἁλίσκονται , ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲν αὐτοὺς ἐπιλύεται ἡ ἡλικία τὸ μὴ οὐχὶ ἀγανακτεῖν τῇ παρούσῃ τύχῃ .	Crito . Other men as old , Socrates , become involved in similar misfortunes , but their age does not in the least prevent them from being disturbed by their fate .	165	Crito. And others, Socrates, of such an age and in such misfortunes are captured, but their age does not relieve them of being indignant at their present fate.	Crito . And others, Socrates, who are in similar misfortunes, are at their age, but their age does not prevent them from being indignant at their present fate.	Criton. And others, O Socrates, in such misfortunes are caught, but age does not release them from not being aggrieved by the present fate.	Crito. And others, Socrates, are caught in such great troubles, but nothing prevents them from being angry at their present fortune.
Σωκράτης . ἔστι ταῦτα . ἀλλὰ τί δὴ οὕτω πρῲ ἀφῖξαι ;	Socrates . That is true . But why have you come so early ?	166	"Socrates: ""That is true. But why have you arrived so early?"""	Socrates . It is so . But why have you come so early ?	Socrates: It is so. But why have you arrived so early?	Socrates: This is so. But why do you speak so roughly?
Κρίτων . ἀγγελίαν , ὦ Σώκρατες , φέρων χαλεπήν , οὐ σοί , ὡς ἐμοὶ φαίνεται , ἀλλ᾽ ἐμοὶ καὶ τοῖς σοῖς ἐπιτηδείοις πᾶσιν καὶ χαλεπὴν καὶ βαρεῖαν , ἣν ἐγώ , ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκῶ , ἐν τοῖς βαρύτατ᾽ ἂν ἐνέγκαιμι .	Crito . To bring news , Socrates , sad news , though apparently not sad to you , but sad and grievous me and all your friends , and to few of them , I think , so grievous as to me .	167	Crito, bringing a difficult message, Socrates, not to you, as it seems to me, but to me and to all your companions, both difficult and grievous, which I, as it seems to me, could scarcely bear.	Crito. A message, Socrates, which I bring, painful, not to you, as it seems to me, but to me and all your friends, and hard and heavy to bear, which I, as it seems to me, would most gladly not have to bear.	Criton: I bear a difficult message, O Socrates, not for you, as it seems to me, but for me and all your friends, a message that is both hard and burdensome, which I, as it seems to me, would find most difficult to bear.	Crito. A message, Socrates, I bring, a difficult one, not for you, as it seems to me, but for you and all your friends, and it is both difficult and burdensome. I think I can bear it most heavily.
Σωκράτης . τίνα ταύτην ; ἢ τὸ πλοῖον ἀφῖκται ἐκ Δήλου , οὗ δεῖ ἀφικομένου τεθνάναι με ;	Socrates . What is this news ? Has the ship come from Delos , at the arrival of which I am to die ?	168	Socrates: What is this? Has the ship arrived from Delos, upon whose arrival I must die?	Socrates . What is this ? Has the ship come from Delos , at the arrival of which I am to die ?	Socrates: What is this? Or has the ship arrived from Delos, where I must go to die?	Socrates. What is this? Or has the ship from Delos arrived, in which I must die when it arrives?
Κρίτων . οὔτοι δὴ ἀφῖκται , ἀλλὰ δοκεῖν μέν μοι ἥξει τήμερον ἐξ ὧν ἀπαγγέλλουσιν ἥκοντές τινες ἀπὸ Σουνίου καὶ καταλιπόντες ἐκεῖ αὐτό .	Crito . It has not exactly come , but I think it will come today from the reports of some men who have come from Sunium and left it there .	169	Crito: He has not yet arrived, but it seems to me that he will come today, based on reports from some who have returned from Sounion and left him there.	Crito . Not yet, but I think that he will come today, judging from what certain people report who have come from Sunium and left him there.	Crito: Indeed, they have not arrived, but it seems to me that today some messengers from Sounion will come, having left the matter there.	Socrates. But it seems to me that it will come to pass today, as those who have come from Sunium and left it behind tell us.
δῆλον οὖν ἐκ τούτων τῶν ἀγγέλων ὅτι ἥξει τήμερον , καὶ ἀνάγκη δὴ εἰς αὔριον ἔσται , ὦ Σώκρατες , τὸν βίον σε τελευτᾶν .	Now it is clear from what they say that it will come today , and so tomorrow , Socrates , your life must end .	170	It is clear then from these messages that he will come today, and it is necessary, Socrates, that you will end your life tomorrow.	It is clear from these messengers, then, that it will come today, and it is necessary that tomorrow will be the day, Socrates, that you will end your life.	It is clear from these angels that you will arrive today, and it is necessary that, by tomorrow, you will end your life, O Socrates.	It is clear from these angels that they will come today, and it is necessary, Socrates, that your life will end tomorrow.
Σωκράτης . ἀλλ᾽ , ὦ Κρίτων , τύχῃ ἀγαθῇ , εἰ ταύτῃ τοῖς θεοῖς φίλον , ταύτῃ ἔστω : οὐ μέντοι οἶμαι ἥξειν αὐτὸ τήμερον .	Socrates . Well , Crito , good luck be with us ! If this is the will of the gods , so be it . However , I do not think it will come today .	171	Socrates: But, Crito, so be it with good fortune, if this is pleasing to the gods, let it be so: however, I do not think it will happen today.	Socrates . But, Crito, may it be for the best, if it is the will of the gods that it should be so; but I do not think that it will come to-day.	Socrates: But, O Crito, if it is pleasing to the gods, let it be so; however, I do not think that it will happen today.	Socrates. But, O Crito, by good fortune, if it is pleasing to the gods, let it be so: but I do not think it will be so today.
Κρίτων . πόθεν τοῦτο τεκμαίρῃ ;	Crito . What is your reason for not thinking so ?	172	Crito: How do you infer that?	Crito, how do you infer this?	Criton. From where do you deduce this?	Socrates. How do you know this?
Σωκράτης . ἐγώ σοι ἐρῶ . τῇ γάρ που ὑστεραίᾳ δεῖ με ἀποθνῄσκειν ἢ ᾗ ἂν ἔλθῃ τὸ πλοῖον .	Socrates . I will tell you . I must die on the day after the ship comes in , must I not ?	173	Socrates: I will tell you. For the next day I must die or whenever the ship arrives.	Socrates: I will tell you. For I must die the day after tomorrow, or the day the ship arrives.	Socrates: I will tell you. For I must die the day after tomorrow, or whenever the ship arrives.	Socrates: I will tell you. For it is either the day after tomorrow or when the ship comes that I must die.
Κρίτων . φασί γέ τοι δὴ οἱ τούτων κύριοι .	Crito . So those say who have charge of these matters .	174	Crito: Indeed, their masters say so.	Crito . For the masters of these men, as they say, are coming.	Criton. Indeed, those who are in charge say so.	Crito. They say, at least, that these men are your masters.
Σωκράτης . οὐ τοίνυν τῆς ἐπιούσης ἡμέρας οἶμαι αὐτὸ ἥξειν ἀλλὰ τῆς ἑτέρας .	Socrates . Well , I think it will not come in today , but tomorrow .	175	Socrates: I do not think it will come the next day but the one after.	Socrates: I do not think it will arrive tomorrow, but the day after.	Socrates. Therefore, I do not think that it will come tomorrow, but rather the day after.	Socrates. I do not think, therefore, that it will come tomorrow but the next day.
τεκμαίρομαι δὲ ἔκ τινος ἐνυπνίου ὃ ἑώρακα ὀλίγον πρότερον ταύτης τῆς νυκτός : καὶ κινδυνεύεις ἐν καιρῷ τινι οὐκ ἐγεῖραί με .	And my reason for this is a dream which I had a little while ago in the course of this night . And perhaps you let me sleep just at the right time	176	I make a conjecture from a certain dream that I saw a little earlier this night: and you are likely in some time not to wake me up.	I infer from a dream I had a little earlier in the night; and you are in danger of not waking me up at some point.	I infer from a certain dream that I saw a little before this night: and you may be in danger at some time not to wake me.	I am also in doubt because of a dream I had a little while ago this night: and you are in danger of not waking me at some time.
Κρίτων . ἦν δὲ δὴ τί τὸ ἐνύπνιον ;	Crito . What was the dream ?	177	Crito: And what was the dream?	Crito . What was the dream about ?	Crito. And what was the dream?	Socrates. What was the dream?
"Σωκράτης . ἐδόκει τίς μοι γυνὴ προσελθοῦσα καλὴ καὶ εὐειδής , λευκὰ ἱμάτια ἔχουσα , καλέσαι με καὶ εἰπεῖν : ‘ὦ Σώκρατες , "" ἤματί κεν τριτάτῳ Φθίην ἐρίβωλον ἵκοιο . """	"Socrates .

It seemed to me that a woman, fair and with a pleasant face, having white clothes, came up to me and called me, saying: ""Oh Socrates, I have come to you on the third day of the month of Phthiotis."""
Κρίτων . ἄτοπον τὸ ἐνύπνιον , ὦ Σώκρατες .	Crito . A strange dream , Socrates .	179	Crito: The dream is strange, Socrates.	Crito . A strange dream, Socrates.	Crito: The dream is strange, O Socrates.	Crito. It is a strange dream, Socrates.

Socrates . It is clear, then, I suppose, Crito.	Socrates. It seems clear to me, O Crito.	Socrates. It is clear, I think, O Crito.
Κρίτων . λίαν γε , ὡς ἔοικεν .	Crito . Too clear , apparently .	181	Crito: Very much so, it seems.	Crito . Very much so , it seems .	Crito: Indeed, it seems so.	Crito. Very well, as it seems.
ἀλλ᾽ , ὦ δαιμόνιε Σώκρατες , ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐμοὶ πιθοῦ καὶ σώθητι : ὡς ἐμοί , ἐὰν σὺ ἀποθάνῃς , οὐ μία συμφορά ἐστιν , ἀλλὰ χωρὶς μὲν τοῦ ἐστερῆσθαι τοιούτου ἐπιτηδείου οἷον ἐγὼ οὐδένα μή ποτε εὑρήσω , ἔτι δὲ καὶ πολλοῖς δόξω , οἳ ἐμὲ καὶ σὲ μὴ σαφῶς ἴσασιν , ὡς οἷός τ᾽ ὤν σε σῴζειν εἰ ἤθελον ἀναλίσκειν χρήματα , ἀμελῆσαι .	But , my dear Socrates , even now listen to me and save yourself . Since , if you die , it will be no mere single misfortune to me , but I shall lose a friend such as I can never find again , and besides , many persons who do not know you and me well will think I could have saved you if I had been willing to spend money , but that I would not take the trouble .	182	But, O divine Socrates, even now obey me and be saved. For to me, if you die, it will not be a single misfortune; but apart from being deprived of such a companion as I shall never find again, many will think, who do not know me and you clearly, that I could	But, dear Socrates, I implore you once more to take my advice and save yourself. For if you die, it will not be a single misfortune for me, but, apart from being deprived of a companion such as I shall never find again, the world will think that I might have saved you if	But, O divine Socrates, still even now trust me and save yourself: for to me, if you die, it is not one misfortune, but besides being deprived of such a companion as I shall never find again, I will also seem to many who do not know me and you clearly, that being able	But, O demon Socrates, still hold on to life and be saved: for if you die, I shall suffer not one loss, but I shall be deprived of a most agreeable companion, such as I shall never find again; and, besides, I shall be thought by many, who do not clearly know
καίτοι τίς ἂν αἰσχίων εἴη ταύτης δόξα ἢ δοκεῖν χρήματα περὶ πλείονος ποιεῖσθαι ἢ φίλους ; οὐ γὰρ πείσονται οἱ πολλοὶ ὡς σὺ αὐτὸς οὐκ ἠθέλησας ἀπιέναι ἐνθένδε ἡμῶν προθυμουμένων .	And yet what reputation could be more disgraceful than that of considering one ' s money of more importance than one ' s friends ? For most people will not believe that we were eager to help you to go away from here , but you refused .	183	Yet what reputation could be more shameful than this, or to seem to value money more highly than friends? For the majority will not be persuaded, since you yourself did not wish to leave here when we were eager.	And yet what reputation could be more shameful than to be thought to value money more highly than friends? For the many will not be persuaded that you yourself were unwilling to go hence, when we were eager to have you stay.	And yet, who would think that it is more shameful to be thought to value money more than friends? For most will not be convinced that you yourself did not wish to leave from here while we were eager.	Even if it were a shame to be thought of as making money for more people or friends, for the many will not believe that you yourself did not want to leave here with us eager to do so.
Σωκράτης . ἀλλὰ τί ἡμῖν , ὦ μακάριε Κρίτων , οὕτω τῆς τῶν πολλῶν δόξης μέλει ; οἱ γὰρ ἐπιεικέστατοι , ὧν μᾶλλον ἄξιον φροντίζειν , ἡγήσονται αὐτὰ οὕτω πεπρᾶχθαι ὥσπερ ἂν πραχθῇ .	Socrates . But , my dear Crito , why do we care so much for what most people think ? For the most reasonable men , whose opinion is more worth considering , will think that things were done as they really will be done .	184	Socrates: But why, blessed Crito, do we care so much about the opinion of the many? For the most reasonable people, whose opinion is worth considering, will think that things have been done just as they have been done.	Socrates . But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion of the many? Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering, will think of these things truly as they occurred.	Socrates: But what is it to us, O blessed Crito, to be so concerned with the opinion of the many? For the most honorable individuals, those who are more worthy of our concern, will consider that these things have happened just as they have occurred.	Socrates. But what care we, O blessed Crito, for the opinion of the many? For the most just, of whom it is most worth while to think, will think that these things have been done as if they had been done.
Κρίτων . ἀλλ᾽ ὁρᾷς δὴ ὅτι ἀνάγκη , ὦ Σώκρατες , καὶ τῆς τῶν πολλῶν δόξης μέλειν . αὐτὰ δὲ δῆλα τὰ παρόντα νυνὶ ὅτι οἷοί τ᾽ εἰσὶν οἱ πολλοὶ οὐ τὰ σμικρότατα τῶν κακῶν ἐξεργάζεσθαι ἀλλὰ τὰ μέγιστα σχεδόν , ἐάν τις ἐν αὐτοῖς διαβεβλημένος ᾖ .	Crito . But you see it is necessary , Socrates , to care for the opinion of the public , for this very trouble we are in now shows that the public is able to accomplish not by any means the least , but almost the greatest of evils , if one has a bad reputation with it .	185	Crito. But you see indeed, Socrates, that it is necessary to take heed of the opinion of the many. It is now clear that the multitude are indeed capable not only of inflicting the smallest of evils but also nearly the greatest, if one is slandered among them.	Crito . But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be regarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest evil to anyone who has lost their good opinion.	Criton. But surely, Socrates, you see that it is necessary to care about the opinion of the many. It is evident that those who are in the public eye do not just suffer the slightest evils, but are almost driven to endure the greatest, if someone is slandered among them.	Crito. But see, Socrates, that it is necessary to care for the opinion of the many. And it is clear from the present circumstances that the many are able to do the greatest of evils, almost, if someone is placed among them.
Σωκράτης . εἰ γὰρ ὤφελον , ὦ Κρίτων , οἷοί τ᾽ εἶναι οἱ πολλοὶ τὰ μέγιστα κακὰ ἐργάζεσθαι , ἵνα οἷοί τ᾽ ἦσαν καὶ ἀγαθὰ τὰ μέγιστα , καὶ καλῶς ἂν εἶχεν . νῦν δὲ οὐδέτερα οἷοί τε : οὔτε γὰρ φρόνιμον οὔτε ἄφρονα δυνατοὶ ποιῆσαι , ποιοῦσι δὲ τοῦτο ὅτι ἂν τύχωσι .	Socrates . I only wish , Crito , the people could accomplish the greatest evils , that they might be able to accomplish also the greatest good things . Then all would be well . But now they can do neither of the two ; for they are not able to make a man wise or foolish , but they do whatever occurs to them .	186	"Socrates: ""For if only the many were able, Crito, to cause the greatest evils, then they would also be able to achieve the greatest goods, and it would be well. But now they are capable of neither: they can neither make a man wise nor unwise, but they do whatever"	Socrates . For if, my dear Crito, the many could do the greatest evil, they would also be able to do the greatest good, and that would be well. But now they can do neither; for they cannot make a man either wise or foolish, but they do whatever occurs to them.	Socrates: For if only, oh Crito, the many were able to accomplish the greatest evils, so that they were also capable of achieving the greatest goods, then it would indeed be well. But now, they are neither capable: for they are unable to create either wise or foolish things, but they	Socrates. For if I were able, O Crito, how great are the many in doing the greatest evils, so that they were also the greatest good, and it would be well. But now they are neither: neither wise nor foolish able to do, but they do this as they can.
Κρίτων . ταῦτα μὲν δὴ οὕτως ἐχέτω : τάδε δέ , ὦ Σώκρατες , εἰπέ μοι . ἆρά γε μὴ ἐμοῦ προμηθῇ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἐπιτηδείων μή , ἐὰν σὺ ἐνθένδε ἐξέλθῃς , οἱ συκοφάνται ἡμῖν πράγματα παρέχωσιν ὡς σὲ ἐνθένδε ἐκκλέψασιν , καὶ ἀναγκασθῶμεν ἢ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν οὐσίαν ἀποβαλεῖν ἢ συχνὰ χρήματα , ἢ καὶ ἄλλο τι πρὸς τούτοις παθεῖν ; εἰ γάρ τι τοιοῦτον φοβῇ , ἔασον αὐτὸ χαίρειν : ἡμεῖς γάρ που δίκαιοί ἐσμεν σώσαντές σε κινδυνεύειν τοῦτον τὸν κίνδυνον καὶ ἐὰν δέῃ ἔτι τούτου μείζω .	Crito . That may well be . But , Socrates , tell me this : you are not considering me and your other friends , are you , fearing that , if you escape , the informers will make trouble for us by saying that we stole you away , and we shall be forced to lose either all our property or a good deal of money , or be punished in some other way besides ? For if you are afraid of anything of that kind , let it go ; since it is right for us to run this risk , and even greater risk than this , if necessary , provided we save you .	187	Crito: So be it; but tell me this, Socrates: Don't you worry about me and your other friends, that if you escape from here, it will bring trouble upon us, as if we had stolen you away, and we will be forced either to lose all our possessions or pay large sums of money	Crito. Let these things be so, Socrates; but tell me this: are you not anxious for me and for the others who are your friends, if by taking you hence we shall incur danger, as the informers will say that we stole you away, and shall we not be compelled either to lose all	Crito. Let it be so. But tell me this, Socrates: Is it not possible that, when you leave here, the informers will fabricate charges against us, as if you had escaped from here, and we would be forced either to lose all our possessions or to pay a large sum of money,	Κρίτων. Ταῦτα μὲν δὴ οὕτως ἐχέτω : τάδε δέ, ὦ Σώκρατες, εἰπέ μοι. ἆρά γε μὴ ἐμοῦ προμηθῇ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἐπιτη
ἀλλ᾽ ἐμοὶ πείθου καὶ μὴ ἄλλως ποίει .	Now please do as I ask .	188	But obey me and do not act otherwise.	But obey me and do not do otherwise.	But listen to me and do not act otherwise.	But persuade me and do not act otherwise.
Σωκράτης . καὶ ταῦτα προμηθοῦμαι , ὦ Κρίτων , καὶ ἄλλα πολλά .	Socrates . I am considering this , Crito , and many other things .	189	Socrates: And I take care of these things, Crito, and many others besides.	Socrates . And I consider this, Crito, and many other things.	Socrates. And I will consider these things, O Crito, and many others.	Socrates. And I am also forewarned, O Crito, and of many other things.
Κρίτων . μήτε τοίνυν ταῦτα φοβοῦ — καὶ γὰρ οὐδὲ πολὺ τἀργύριόν ἐστιν ὃ θέλουσι λαβόντες τινὲς σῶσαί σε καὶ ἐξαγαγεῖν ἐνθένδε .	Crito . Well , do not fear this ! for it is not even a large sum of money which we should pay to some men who are willing to save you and get you away from here .	190	Crito: So do not fear these things — for the money is not much that some want to take to save you and get you out of here.	Crito . Do not then be afraid of this; for the sum of money is even not large which some persons are willing to take and save you and bring you out of this place.	Crito. Therefore, do not fear these things — for it is not a large amount of money that some would take in order to save you and bring you out of here.	Crito. Fear not, then, these things — for, indeed, the silver is not much which some who wish to save you and lead you out of here are willing to give.
ἔπειτα οὐχ ὁρᾷς τούτους τοὺς συκοφάντας ὡς εὐτελεῖς , καὶ οὐδὲν ἂν δέοι ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς πολλοῦ ἀργυρίου ;	Besides , don ' t you see how cheap these informers are , and that not much money would be needed to silence them ?	191	Then don't you see how worthless these sycophants are, and wouldn't it take much money against them?	Do you not see that these informers are worthless, and that no large sum of money would be required to deal with them?	Then do you not see these informers as worthless, and would it be of any importance to spend a great amount of silver on them?	Then do you not see these sycophants as cheap, and would not a little silver suffice for them?

And you have my money at your command , which is enough , I fancy ; and moreover , if because you care for me you think you ought not to spend my money , there are foreigners here willing to spend theirs ; and one of them , Simmias of Thebes , has brought for this especial purpose sufficient funds ; and Cebes also and very many others are ready .	192	But you have my money, which I think is sufficient; and besides, if you think it is not right to spend my own funds because you are concerned for me, these strangers here are ready to spend theirs. One of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a sufficient amount of silver for this very	You have my money, as I suppose, and if you are anxious about the expense, it will not be very great, I think. At any rate, I have enough to pay for the poison. I have not forgotten that I owe Asclepius a cock.	You have my money in sufficient quantity, as I believe. Moreover, if you think that you should not spend your own for my sake, these strangers here are ready to spend theirs. One of them, Simmias the Theban, has already collected a sufficient amount of silver for this purpose, and so too are	But you have my money, as I suppose, enough; and if you are thinking of me, you do not think it necessary to spend it, for these strangers are ready to spend it here: and one of them has already spent a considerable sum on this account, Simmias the Theban, and Ceb

And do not be troubled by what you said in the court , that if you went away you would not know what to do with yourself .	193	Therefore, as I say, do not wear yourself out trying to save yourself because of fear of these things, nor let it be difficult for you, as you said in the court, that you would not be able to go out and deal with yourself.	so that, as I say, you may not, on the one hand, through fear of these things, be too lazy to save yourself, nor, on the other hand, as you said in the court, be troubled because you do not know what to do with yourself when you have escaped from here:	Therefore, I say that you should neither become weary in saving yourself out of fear of these things, nor should, as you said in the court, it be difficult for you that you would not be able to go out because of what you have done to yourself.	So that, as I say, you neither, fearing these things, lose yourself and save yourself, nor, as you said in court, find it difficult for you that you would not have gone out because you would have been useful to yourself.

For in many other places , wherever you go , they will welcome you ; and if you wish to go to Thessaly , I have friends there who will make much of you and will protect you , so that no one in Thessaly shall annoy you .	194	For in many places and elsewhere wherever you might arrive, they will love you: But if you wish to go to Thessaly, I have friends there who will treat you highly and provide you with security, so that none of the Thessalians will harm you.	For in many places, and elsewhere, wherever you may come, people will love you; but if you wish to go to Thessaly, I have friends there who will make much of you and provide you with security, so that no one in Thessaly will trouble you.	For many places, indeed, wherever you may go, they will love you; but if you wish to go to Thessaly, there are foreigners there who will value you highly and will provide you with security, so that you will not be troubled by anyone in Thessaly.	Many places, wherever you may go, they will love you. If you want to go to Thessaly, there are foreigners there who will do a lot for you and will provide you with safety, so that you will not be harmed in Thessaly.
ἔτι δέ , ὦ Σώκρατες , οὐδὲ δίκαιόν μοι δοκεῖς ἐπιχειρεῖν πρᾶγμα , σαυτὸν προδοῦναι , ἐξὸν σωθῆναι , καὶ τοιαῦτα σπεύδεις περὶ σαυτὸν γενέσθαι ἅπερ ἂν καὶ οἱ ἐχθροί σου σπεύσαιέν τε καὶ ἔσπευσαν σὲ διαφθεῖραι βουλόμενοι .	And besides , Socrates , it seems to me the thing you are undertaking to do is not even right — betraying yourself when you might save yourself . And you are eager to bring upon yourself just what your enemies would wish and just what those were eager for who wished to destroy you .	195	Moreover, O Socrates, it seems to me that you are attempting something unjust, to betray yourself when it is possible to be saved, and you are eager for things to happen to yourself which even your enemies would hasten and have hastened, desiring to destroy you.	And besides, Socrates, I do not think that you are justified in betraying yourself, when you might be saved; and I call it a betrayal when a man of your wisdom has come to such a pass as to be willing to take the course that is the easiest, and to give up the best and most	And yet, O Socrates, I do not think it is just for you to attempt to betray yourself, when it is possible for you to be saved, and you are hastening to bring about those things concerning yourself which your enemies would both hasten to do and have hastened to do, wishing to destroy you	"Here is the translation:

But still, Socrates, it seems to me that you are attempting something unjust, to betray yourself, to be saved, and you are in such a hurry for this to happen to you, as your enemies would be and have been in a hurry to destroy you, wanting to."
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις καὶ τοὺς ὑεῖς τοὺς σαυτοῦ ἔμοιγε δοκεῖς προδιδόναι , οὕς σοι ἐξὸν καὶ ἐκθρέψαι καὶ ἐκπαιδεῦσαι οἰχήσῃ καταλιπών , καὶ τὸ σὸν μέρος ὅτι ἂν τύχωσι τοῦτο πράξουσιν : τεύξονται δέ , ὡς τὸ εἰκός , τοιούτων οἷάπερ εἴωθεν γίγνεσθαι ἐν ταῖς ὀρφανίαις περὶ τοὺς ὀρφανούς .	And moreover , I think you are abandoning your children , too , for when you might bring them up and educate them , you are going to desert them and go away , and , so far as you are concerned , their fortunes in life will be whatever they happen to meet with , and they will probably meet with such treatment as generally comes to orphans in their destitution .	196	Moreover, it seems to me that you are betraying your own sons, whom you could both nurture and educate, but you are going away leaving them behind, and that whatever happens to them will be what they will experience: and they are likely to encounter such things as usually happen to orphans.	And besides, you seem to me to be betraying your own sons, whom you might bring up and educate, but instead you will leave them and be gone; and whatever befalls them, that is what they will do: and as is likely, they will experience just what usually happens to orphans in their orphan	And besides this, it seems to me that you are betraying your own sons, whom you can bring up and educate, leaving them to go away, and whatever portion of yours they may have, they will act accordingly: And they will indeed, as is likely, become such as usually happen in orphanages concerning or	Besides, you also seem to me to be betraying your own slaves, whom you are allowed to bring up and educate, leaving them behind, and to do with your own property as you please, provided you can get it. They will probably fare as is usual in the case of orphans.

Either one ought not to beget children , or one ought to stay by them and bring them up and educate them .

It is necessary to choose what a good and brave man would choose, professing to care for virtue throughout all of life.	For either one ought not to have children, or to share in the toils and pains of both nourishing and educating them. But you seem to me to choose the easiest path. But one ought to choose the path which a good and brave man would choose, since you claim to care about virtue throughout your whole life	For one should either not have children or endure the struggles of raising and educating them, but you seem to choose the most leisurely path. It is necessary to choose those things which a good and courageous man would choose, claiming indeed to care for virtue throughout all of life.	Or should we not make children or suffer them to be brought up and fed and educated, but you seem to me to choose the easiest things. We must, however, choose what a good and brave man would choose, and this is to take care of virtue throughout life.
Σωκράτης . ὦ φίλε Κρίτων , ἡ προθυμία σου πολλοῦ ἀξία εἰ μετά τινος ὀρθότητος εἴη : εἰ δὲ μή , ὅσῳ μείζων τοσούτῳ χαλεπωτέρα .	Socrates . My dear Crito , your eagerness is worth a great deal , if it should prove to be rightly directed ; but otherwise , the greater it is , the more hard to bear .	198	Socrates: O dear Crito, your eagerness is worth much if it be accompanied by some correctness; but if not, the greater it is, so much the more troublesome.	Socrates . Dear Crito, your eagerness is worth much, if it should have some rightness to it; but if not, the greater it is, the more difficult it is to deal with.	Socrates. O friend Crito, your eagerness is worthy of much if it is accompanied by some correctness; but if not, it is much more difficult by so much.	Socrates. Oh dear friend Crito, your eagerness is worth a great deal if it were accompanied by some correctness; but if not, the greater the eagerness the greater the difficulty.
σκοπεῖσθαι οὖν χρὴ ἡμᾶς εἴτε ταῦτα πρακτέον εἴτε μή : ὡς ἐγὼ οὐ νῦν πρῶτον ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀεὶ τοιοῦτος οἷος τῶν ἐμῶν μηδενὶ ἄλλῳ πείθεσθαι ἢ τῷ λόγῳ ὃς ἄν μοι λογιζομένῳ βέλτιστος φαίνηται .	So we must examine the question whether we ought to do this or not ; for I am not only now but always a man who follows nothing but the reasoning which on consideration seems to me best .	199	It is necessary for us to consider whether these things must be done or not; as for me, I am always such a person who yields to no one else except to the reason which, when I deliberate, appears best to me.	We must examine whether we should act in this way or not; as for me, I am now and have always been the kind of person who follows nothing but the argument that seems best to me upon reflection.	Therefore, we must consider whether these things should be done or not: as I am not now for the first time, but always such a person who believes in no other than the argument that seems best to me when I reflect on it.	We should therefore consider whether we should do these things or not: as I am not now for the first time but always of the kind that I should obey no one else but the reason which seems to me to be the best when I am thinking.
τοὺς δὴ λόγους οὓς ἐν τῷ ἔμπροσθεν ἔλεγον οὐ δύναμαι νῦν ἐκβαλεῖν , ἐπειδή μοι ἥδε ἡ τύχη γέγονεν , ἀλλὰ σχεδόν τι ὅμοιοι φαίνονταί μοι , καὶ τοὺς αὐτοὺς πρεσβεύω καὶ τιμῶ οὕσπερ καὶ πρότερον :	And I cannot , now that this has happened to us , discard the arguments I used to advance , but they seem to me much the same as ever , and I revere and honor the same ones as before .	200	The words which I spoke previously I cannot now retract, since this fate has befallen me, but they seem to me nearly the same, and I advocate and honor the same things as before.	The words which I spoke before I can no longer now retract, since this fortune has befallen me; but they seem to me to be almost the same, and I make the same requests and value the same things as before:	I cannot now express the words that I mentioned before, since this fortune has come upon me, but they seem to me almost the same, and I honor and regard the same ones as I did before.	These words which I was saying before I am not now able to throw out, because this chance has happened to me, but they seem to me almost similar, and I am pleading and honouring them just as I was before.
ὧν ἐὰν μὴ βελτίω ἔχωμεν λέγειν ἐν τῷ παρόντι , εὖ ἴσθι ὅτι οὐ μή σοι συγχωρήσω , οὐδ᾽ ἂν πλείω τῶν νῦν παρόντων ἡ τῶν πολλῶν δύναμις ὥσπερ παῖδας ἡμᾶς μορμολύττηται , δεσμοὺς καὶ θανάτους ἐπιπέμπουσα καὶ χρημάτων ἀφαιρέσεις .	And unless we can bring forward better ones in our present situation , be assured that I shall not give way to you , not even if the power of the multitude frighten us with even more terrors than at present , as children are frightened with goblins , threatening us with imprisonments and deaths and confiscations of property .	201	If we cannot say anything better in the present, be assured that I will not agree with you, even if the power of the many, frightening us like children with threats of bonds and death and confiscation of property, is greater than those now present.	If we have no better arguments to present at this time, be assured that I will not acquit you, not even if the power of the many were to threaten us like children with bogeys, sending us bonds and death and confiscation of property.	If we have nothing better to say in the present, be assured that I will not forgive you, even if the power of the many, like children, terrifies us with bonds and sends forth death and confiscations of wealth.	If we cannot speak better now, know that I will not allow it, not even if the power of the many, like a nurse, were to treat us like children, sending us bonds and deaths and taking away our money.

By taking up first what you say about opinions and asking whether we were right when we always used to say that we ought to pay attention to some opinions and not to others ?	202	How then could we examine these things most moderately? If, first of all, we take up this argument, which you speak about concerning opinions. Was it rightly said each time or not, that one ought to heed some opinions and not others?

Whether it was said well at each time or not, that one should pay attention to some opinions and not to others?	How then shall we consider these matters moderately? If we first take up this word that you mention concerning the opinions. Was it said well at each time or not, that the mind should attend to some opinions and not to others?	How then shall we consider these things? Shall we first take up the argument you say about opinions? Was it ever spoken well or not, that one should pay attention to opinions in some cases, but not in others?

Or were we right before I was condemned to death , whereas it has now been made clear that we were talking merely for the sake of argument and it was really mere play and nonsense ?

I wish to examine this, O Criton, together with you, to see if I appear any different, since this is how I am"	Or before I was to die it was said that I was well, but now it is clear that it was said for the sake of words, and it was a joke and a lie. I wish, O Crito, to examine it, whether it appears to me to be different from what it was, since I
ἐλέγετο δέ πως , ὡς ἐγᾦμαι , ἑκάστοτε ὧδε ὑπὸ τῶν οἰομένων τὶ λέγειν , ὥσπερ νυνδὴ ἐγὼ ἔλεγον , ὅτι τῶν δοξῶν ἃς οἱ ἄνθρωποι δοξάζουσιν δέοι τὰς μὲν περὶ πολλοῦ ποιεῖσθαι , τὰς δὲ μή .	But it used to be said , I think , by those who thought they were speaking sensibly , just as I was saying now , that of the opinions held by men some ought to be highly esteemed and others not .	204	It was said somehow, as I suppose, each time in this way by those who thought they were saying something, just as I was saying now, that of the opinions which men believe, some should be highly regarded, and others not.	It was said, as I recall, by those who thought they were saying something, just as I was saying now, that of the opinions that people hold, some should be taken seriously, others not.	It was said, as I believe, that each time in this way by those thinking what to say, just as I am now saying that of the opinions which people hold, some should be valued highly, while others should not.	It was said, as I think, every time I was here among those who thought they were saying something, just as I was saying now, that the opinions which people hold dear should be done for many, but not for all.
τοῦτο πρὸς θεῶν , ὦ Κρίτων , οὐ δοκεῖ καλῶς σοι λέγεσθαι ; —	In God ' s name , Crito , do you not think this is correct ?	205	By the gods, Crito, does this not seem well said to you?	Does this seem to you, Crito, a fair statement? —	Does this not seem to you, O Criton, to be said well towards the gods?	This is for the gods, Crito, does not seem well said to you.
σὺ γάρ , ὅσα γε τἀνθρώπεια , ἐκτὸς εἶ τοῦ μέλλειν ἀποθνῄσκειν αὔριον , καὶ οὐκ ἂν σὲ παρακρούοι ἡ παροῦσα συμφορά : σκόπει δή — οὐχ ἱκανῶς δοκεῖ σοι λέγεσθαι ὅτι οὐ πάσας χρὴ τὰς δόξας τῶν ἀνθρώπων τιμᾶν ἀλλὰ τὰς μέν , τὰς δ᾽ οὔ , οὐδὲ πάντων ἀλλὰ τῶν μέν , τῶν δ᾽ οὔ ; τί φῄς ; ταῦτα οὐχὶ καλῶς λέγεται ;	For you , humanly speaking , are not involved in the necessity of dying tomorrow , and therefore present conditions would not lead your judgment astray . Now say , do you not think we were correct in saying that we ought not to esteem all the opinions of men , but some and not others , and not those of all men , but only of some ? What do you think ? Is not this true ?	206	For you, as far as human affairs go, are exempt from fearing death tomorrow, and the present misfortune would not shake you.

Consider this: do you not think that it is said correctly that one should not honor all the opinions of men, but some and not others, not all, but some and not
Κρίτων . καλῶς .	Crito . It is .	207	Criton: well.	Crito . Very well .	Criton. Well.	Crito. Well.
Σωκράτης . οὐκοῦν τὰς μὲν χρηστὰς τιμᾶν , τὰς δὲ πονηρὰς μή ;	Socrates . Then we ought to esteem the good opinions and not the bad ones ?	208	Socrates: Should we not honor the good ones and not the bad ones?	Socrates . Then we ought to honour the good, but not the bad?	Socrates. Therefore, should we honor the good things and not the bad ones?	Socrates. So then we must honour the good and not the bad?
Κρίτων . ναί .	Crito . Yes .	209	Crito: Yes.	Crito . Yes .	Crito. Yes.	Socrates. Yes.
Σωκράτης . χρησταὶ δὲ οὐχ αἱ τῶν φρονίμων , πονηραὶ δὲ αἱ τῶν ἀφρόνων ;	Socrates . And the good ones are those of the wise and the bad ones those of the foolish ?	210	Socrates: But are not the actions of the wise good, and those of the foolish evil?	Socrates . But are not the good the wise, and the evil the foolish?	Socrates: Good things are not those of the wise, but the bad things of the foolish?	Socrates. Are virtues not the characteristics of the wise, and vices those of the foolish?
Κρίτων . πῶς δ᾽ οὔ ;	Crito . Of course .	211	Crito: How could it not be?	Crito . How not ?	Criton. How not?	Socrates. How not?
Σωκράτης . φέρε δή , πῶς αὖ τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐλέγετο ; γυμναζόμενος ἀνὴρ καὶ τοῦτο πράττων πότερον παντὸς ἀνδρὸς ἐπαίνῳ καὶ ψόγῳ καὶ δόξῃ τὸν νοῦν προσέχει , ἢ ἑνὸς μόνου ἐκείνου ὃς ἂν τυγχάνῃ ἰατρὸς ἢ παιδοτρίβης ὤν ;	Socrates . Come then , what used we to say about this ? If a man is an athlete and makes that his business , does he pay attention to every man ' s praise and blame and opinion or to those of one man only who is a physician or a trainer ?	212	Socrates: Come now, how was it said again about such things? Should a man who is exercising and doing this pay attention to the praise or blame and opinion of any man, or only to that of the one person who happens to be a doctor or trainer?	Socrates . Come now , how was it said that such things should be done ? A man in training and doing this , does he pay attention to the praise and blame and opinion of every man , or only to that of the one who happens to be a doctor or a trainer ?	Socrates. Come now, how were such things said again? Does a man who is training and doing this pay attention to the praise and blame and opinion of all men, or only to that of the one person who happens to be a doctor or a trainer of boys?	Socrates. Come now, how were such things said? A man exercising himself and doing this, does he pay attention to the opinion, praise and blame of every man, or to that of one man only, who happens to be a doctor or a trainer?
Κρίτων . ἑνὸς μόνου .	Crito . To those of one man only .	213	Crito. Of one only.	Crito. Of one alone.	Criton. Of one only.	Socrates. Alone.
Σωκράτης . οὐκοῦν φοβεῖσθαι χρὴ τοὺς ψόγους καὶ ἀσπάζεσθαι τοὺς ἐπαίνους τοὺς τοῦ ἑνὸς ἐκείνου ἀλλὰ μὴ τοὺς τῶν πολλῶν .	Socrates . Then he ought to fear the blame and welcome the praise of that one man and not of the multitude .	214	Socrates: Therefore one must fear criticism and welcome praise from that one person rather than from the many.	Socrates: Must we not then fear the blame and welcome the praise of that one man, and not those of the multitude?	Socrates. Therefore, one should fear the criticisms and embrace the praises of that one person, but not those of the many.	Socrates. So then we should fear the censures and praise the praises of one man rather than those of the many.
Κρίτων . δῆλα δή .	Crito . Obviously .	215	Crito: Clearly, indeed.	Crito . Clearly .	Criton. Clearly indeed.	Crito. I see.
Σωκράτης . ταύτῃ ἄρα αὐτῷ πρακτέον καὶ γυμναστέον καὶ ἐδεστέον γε καὶ ποτέον , ᾗ ἂν τῷ ἑνὶ δοκῇ , τῷ ἐπιστάτῃ καὶ ἐπαΐοντι , μᾶλλον ἢ ᾗ σύμπασι τοῖς ἄλλοις .	Socrates . And he must act and exercise and eat and drink as the one man who is his director and who knows the business thinks best rather than as all the others think .	216	Socrates: In this way, one should act and exercise and eat and drink as it seems good to the one who is knowledgeable and skilled rather than to all others.	Socrates . In this way, then, he must act and exercise and eat and drink, in whatever way seems good to the one, the ruler and the one who knows, rather than in whatever way seems good to all the others.	Socrates: Therefore, he must practice, train, eat, and drink in this way, as it seems best to the one who is the master and knowledgeable, rather than as it appears to all others.	Socrates. This, then, is what he must do and practice and need, and always, as it seems to him, to the one who is in charge and who has understanding, rather than as all the others do.
Κρίτων . ἔστι ταῦτα .	Crito . That is true .	217	Crito: That is so.	Crito . It is so .	Criton. It is so.	Crito. This is it.
Σωκράτης . εἶεν . ἀπειθήσας δὲ τῷ ἑνὶ καὶ ἀτιμάσας αὐτοῦ τὴν δόξαν καὶ τοὺς ἐπαίνους , τιμήσας δὲ τοὺς τῶν πολλῶν λόγους καὶ μηδὲν ἐπαϊόντων , ἆρα οὐδὲν κακὸν πείσεται ; γ	Socrates . Well then ; if he disobeys the one man and disregards his opinion and his praise , but regards words of the many who have no special knowledge , will he not come to harm ?	218	Socrates: Well, if he disobeys the one and dishonors his reputation and praises, but values the words of the many who know nothing, will he not suffer any harm?	Socrates . Very well . But if he disobeys the one and disregards his opinion and his praise , but honors the words of the many and their praise , even though they know nothing , will he not suffer some evil ?	Socrates. Indeed. If someone disobeys the one and dishonors his reputation and praises, while honoring the words of the many and being ignorant of anything, will he not suffer any harm?	Socrates. Yes. But if he disobeys one and dishonors his opinion and praise, and honors the opinions of the many who are not wise, will he not be persuaded to do something bad?
Κρίτων . πῶς γὰρ οὔ ;	Crito . Of course he will .	219	Crito: How could it not be?	Crito . How could it be otherwise ?	Crito. Why not?	Crito. How not?
Σωκράτης . τί δ᾽ ἔστι τὸ κακὸν τοῦτο , καὶ ποῖ τείνει , καὶ εἰς τί τῶν τοῦ ἀπειθοῦντος ;	Socrates . And what is this harm ? In what direction and upon what part of the one who disobeys does it act ?	220	Socrates: What is this evil, and to what does it tend, and into what of those of the disobedient?	Socrates . What is this evil , and what is its object , and in what part of the disobedient person ?	Socrates. What is this evil, and where does it lead, and what does it relate to in the case of the disobedient?	Socrates. What is this evil, and in what direction does it tend, and to what in the man who disobeys?
Κρίτων . δῆλον ὅτι εἰς τὸ σῶμα : τοῦτο γὰρ διόλλυσι .	Crito . Evidently upon his body ; for that is what it ruins .	221	Crito: It is clear that it concerns the body, for this destroys it.	Crito . Clearly in the body, for that is destroyed.	Crito: It is clear that this is about the body; for it perishes.	Crito. It is clear that it is to the body: this is what it corrupts.
Σωκράτης . καλῶς λέγεις . οὐκοῦν καὶ τἆλλα , ὦ Κρίτων , οὕτως , ἵνα μὴ πάντα διΐωμεν , καὶ δὴ καὶ περὶ τῶν δικαίων καὶ ἀδίκων καὶ αἰσχρῶν καὶ καλῶν καὶ ἀγαθῶν καὶ κακῶν , περὶ ὧν νῦν ἡ βουλὴ ἡμῖν ἐστιν , πότερον τῇ τῶν πολλῶν δόξῃ δεῖ ἡμᾶς ἕπεσθαι καὶ φοβεῖσθαι αὐτὴν ἢ τῇ τοῦ ἑνός , εἴ τίς ἐστιν ἐπαΐων , ὃν δεῖ καὶ αἰσχύνεσθαι καὶ φοβεῖσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ σύμπαντας τοὺς ἄλλους ; ᾧ εἰ μὴ ἀκολουθήσομεν , διαφθεροῦμεν ἐκεῖνο καὶ λωβησόμεθα , ὃ τῷ μὲν δικαίῳ βέλτιον ἐγίγνετο τῷ δὲ ἀδίκῳ ἀπώλλυτο . ἢ οὐδέν ἐστι τοῦτο ;	Socrates . Right . Then in other matters , not to enumerate them all , in questions of right and wrong and disgraceful and noble and good and bad , which we are now considering , ought we to follow and fear the opinion of the many or that of the one , if there is anyone who knows about them , whom we ought to revere and fear more than all the others ? And if we do not follow him , we shall injure and cripple that which we used to say is benefited by the right and is ruined by the wrong . Or is there nothing in this ?	222	"Socrates: ""You speak well. Then, should not the same apply to other matters, Crito, so as not to consider them all in detail, and indeed concerning what is just and unjust, shameful and beautiful, good and bad, about which we are now deliberating; whether we ought to follow"	Socrates . You speak well . Then are we to say the same of the rest , Crito , or are we to make an exception here ? Are we to say that we must not on any account oppose the opinions and practices of the multitude , either in this or in any other matter ? For instance , in the	Socrates: You speak well. Therefore, concerning the other matters, O Crito, let us consider them in such a way as not to pursue everything, specifically regarding the just and the unjust, the shameful and the beautiful, the good and the bad, about which we now have a decision to make:	Socrates. Well said. So, then, let us not pursue all things, O Crito, lest we become like the many, and especially in matters of justice and injustice, beauty and ugliness, good and evil, about which our deliberation is now. Shall we follow the opinion of the many and fear
Κρίτων . οἶμαι ἔγωγε , ὦ Σώκρατες .	Crito . I think it is true , Socrates .	223	Crito: I think so, Socrates.	Crito . I think so , Socrates .	Crito: I think that I, at least, oh Socrates.	Crito. I think, at least, Socrates.
Σωκράτης . φέρε δή , ἐὰν τὸ ὑπὸ τοῦ ὑγιεινοῦ μὲν βέλτιον γιγνόμενον , ὑπὸ τοῦ νοσώδους δὲ διαφθειρόμενον διολέσωμεν πειθόμενοι μὴ τῇ τῶν ἐπαϊόντων δόξῃ , ἆρα βιωτὸν ἡμῖν ἐστιν διεφθαρμένου αὐτοῦ ; ἔστι δέ που τοῦτο σῶμα : ἢ οὐχί ;	Socrates . Well then , if through yielding to the opinion of the ignorant we ruin that which is benefited by health and injured by disease , is life worth living for us when that is ruined ? And that is the body , is it not ?	224	Socrates: Come now, if we destroy what becomes better under the influence of what is healthy, but is corrupted under the influence of what is diseased, by not following the opinion of the experts, is it possible for us to live after it is destroyed? And this, presumably, is the body, or	Socrates . Come then , if we destroy that which is made better by the wholesome and is corrupted by the diseased , supposing we are persuaded not by the opinion of the many but by the truth , shall we be able to live when it has been corrupted ? And this , I suppose , is the body ,	Socrates: Come now, if what is produced by the healthy is better, and what is destroyed by the unhealthy, we should not be persuaded by the opinion of the experts, is it possible for us to live with something that is corrupted? Certainly, this body exists somewhere: or does it not?	Socrates: Come now, if we were to follow the reasoning that the body is improved by health and corrupted by disease, would it be possible for us to live a good life if it is corrupted? Is there not a body: or is there not?
Κρίτων . ναί .	Crito . Yes .	225	Crito: Yes.	Crito . Yes .	Crito. Yes.	Socrates. Yes.
Σωκράτης . ἆρ᾽ οὖν βιωτὸν ἡμῖν ἐστιν μετὰ μοχθηροῦ καὶ διεφθαρμένου σώματος ;	Socrates . Then is life worth living when the body is worthless and ruined ?	226	"Socrates: ""Is life worth living for us with a wicked and corrupt body?"""	Socrates . Is life worth living when the body is in a miserable and corrupted state ?	Socrates. Is it then possible for us to live with a wicked and corrupt body?	Socrates. Is life then possible for us with a wicked and corrupted body?
Κρίτων . οὐδαμῶς .	Crito . Certainly not .	227	Crito: Not at all.	Crito . By no means .	Crito: Certainly not.	Crito. Not at all.
Σωκράτης . ἀλλὰ μετ᾽ ἐκείνου ἄρ᾽ ἡμῖν βιωτὸν διεφθαρμένου , ᾧ τὸ ἄδικον μὲν λωβᾶται , τὸ δὲ δίκαιον ὀνίνησιν ; ἢ φαυλότερον ἡγούμεθα εἶναι τοῦ σώματος ἐκεῖνο , ὅτι ποτ᾽ ἐστὶ τῶν ἡμετέρων , περὶ ὃ ἥ τε ἀδικία καὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη ἐστίν ;	Socrates . But is it worth living when that is ruined which is injured by the wrong and improved by the right ? Or do we think that part of us , whatever it is , which is concerned with right and wrong , is less important than the body ?	228	Socrates: But is life bearable for us with that [part] of us corrupted, [that part] through which injustice harms and justice benefits? Or do we consider that which pertains to our body to be of less worth than that which concerns justice and injustice?	Socrates . But can we live when it is destroyed, if that in us which is destroyed is that by which injustice is harmed and justice benefited? Or do we consider it of less value than the body, this thing, whatever it is, that is concerned with justice and injustice?	Socrates. But after that, is life for us corrupted, in which injustice indeed is harmed, while justice benefits? Or do we consider that body to be more base, since it is one of ours, regarding which both injustice and justice exist?	Socrates. But with him, then, shall we live a life corrupted, in which the unjust is honoured and the just is dishonoured? Or do we think that the body, which is one of our own, is less noble than that, in which both injustice and justice are?
Κρίτων . οὐδαμῶς .	Crito . By no means .	229	Crito: By no means.	Crito . By no means .	Crito: Not at all.	Crito. Not at all.
Σωκράτης . ἀλλὰ τιμιώτερον ;	Socrates . But more important ?	230	Socrates: But what is more honorable?	Socrates . But more honourable ?	Socrates. But what is more honorable?	Socrates. But what is more honourable?
Κρίτων . πολύ γε .	Crito . Much more .	231	Crito: Very much so.	Crito . Very much so .	Crito: Indeed, very much so.	Crito. Very well.
Σωκράτης . οὐκ ἄρα , ὦ βέλτιστε , πάνυ ἡμῖν οὕτω φροντιστέον τί ἐροῦσιν οἱ πολλοὶ ἡμᾶς , ἀλλ᾽ ὅτι ὁ ἐπαΐων περὶ τῶν δικαίων καὶ ἀδίκων , ὁ εἷς καὶ αὐτὴ ἡ ἀλήθεια .	Socrates . Then , most excellent friend , we must not consider at all what the many will say of us , but what he who knows about right and wrong , the one man , and truth herself will say .	232	"Socrates: ""So, my good man, we should not be overly concerned with what the many will say to us, but rather with what the knowledgeable one about justice and injustice, the one expert, and the very truth will say."""	Socrates . Then we must not at all, my excellent friend, care what the many will say of us, but what he will say who knows the just and the unjust, the one man and the very truth.	Socrates. Therefore, my best friend, we should not be overly concerned about what the many will say about us, but rather that the expert on just and unjust matters, the one and the same is the truth.	Socrates. So, then, we must not pay much attention to what the many say, but rather to what is true about justice and injustice.
ὥστε πρῶτον μὲν ταύτῃ οὐκ ὀρθῶς εἰσηγῇ , εἰσηγούμενος τῆς τῶν πολλῶν δόξης δεῖν ἡμᾶς φροντίζειν περὶ τῶν δικαίων καὶ καλῶν καὶ ἀγαθῶν καὶ τῶν ἐναντίων .	And so you introduced the discussion wrongly in the first place , when you began by saying we ought to consider the opinion of the multitude about the right and the noble and the good and their opposites .	233	So, first, you are not correctly advising her in this, advising that we ought to care about the opinions of the many concerning what is just, noble, good, and their opposites.	so that, first of all, you are not correct in this, in suggesting that we should care about the opinion of the many concerning the just and noble and good things and their opposites.	Therefore, first of all, you do not rightly propose this, suggesting that we ought to concern ourselves with justice, beauty, and goodness, as well as their opposites.	So first of all, you are not correctly introducing this, introducing the glory of the many, we must be concerned with the just, the good, the beautiful, and the opposite.
ἔννοιά ποθ᾽ ἡμῖν ἐγένετο ὅσαι δημοκρατίαι κατελύθησαν ὑπὸ τῶν ἄλλως πως βουλομένων πολιτεύεσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ ἐν δημοκρατίᾳ , ὅσαι τ᾽ αὖ μοναρχίαι , ὅσαι τε ὀλιγαρχίαι ἀνῄρηνται ἤδη ὑπὸ δήμων , καὶ ὅσοι τυραννεῖν ἐπιχειρήσαντες οἱ μὲν αὐτῶν καὶ ταχὺ πάμπαν κατελύθησαν , οἱ δὲ κἂν ὁποσονοῦν χρόνον ἄρχοντες διαγένωνται , θαυμάζονται ὡς σοφοί τε καὶ εὐτυχεῖς ἄνδρες γεγενημένοι .	The thought once occurred to us how many republics have been overthrown by people who preferred to live under any form of government other than a republican , and again , how many monarchies and how many oligarchies in times past have been abolished by the people . We reflected , moreover , how many of those individuals who have aspired to absolute power have either been deposed once for all and that right quickly ; or if they have continued in power , no matter for how short a time , they are objects of wonder as having proved to be wise and happy men .	234	At one time, we considered how many democracies were destroyed by those wishing to govern in another manner rather than in a democracy, and how many monarchies, and how many oligarchies have already been overthrown by the people, and how many attempted to become tyrants, some of whom were quickly utterly destroyed	We have considered what kinds of democracies are so constituted as to have a long life, and similarly what kinds of oligarchies have a long life; and after this we have considered under what conditions these systems are liable to be overthrown.	The idea occurred to us regarding all the democracies that have been overthrown by those who wished to govern otherwise than in democracy, and likewise all the monarchies and oligarchies that have already been destroyed by the people, and those who attempted to be tyrants, some of whom were quickly completely overthrown	It seems that we have conceived the notion that all democracies have been overthrown by those who wished to govern in some other way rather than in a democracy, while all monarchies and oligarchies have already been abolished by the people, and those who have attempted to tyrannize have either been completely overthrown or
πολλοὺς δ᾽ ἐδοκοῦμεν καταμεμαθηκέναι καὶ ἐν ἰδίοις οἴκοις τοὺς μὲν ἔχοντας καὶ πλείονας οἰκέτας , τοὺς δὲ καὶ πάνυ ὀλίγους , καὶ ὅμως οὐδὲ τοῖς ὀλίγοις τούτοις πάνυ τι δυναμένους χρῆσθαι πειθομένοις τοὺς δεσπότας .	Then , too , we had observed , we thought , that even in private homes some people who had rather more than the usual number of servants and some also who had only a very few were nevertheless , though nominally masters , quite unable to assert their authority over even those few .	235	And we seemed to have observed many, both in their own homes, some having more servants, and others very few, yet not being able to manage even those few effectively, who were not obedient to their masters.	And we seemed to have learned many things also in private houses, some having more servants, others very few, and yet the masters not being able to use even these few effectively, though persuaded.	We believed that many had learned this skill and, in their own homes, some having more servants and others very few; and yet even those with few were hardly able to make use of them, persuaded as they were by their masters.	Many of them seemed to have been well-educated and in their own homes they had some slaves, but many more, and yet they were not able to use them effectively, as they were easily intimidated by their masters.
ἔτι δὲ πρὸς τούτοις ἐνενοοῦμεν ὅτι ἄρχοντες μέν εἰσι καὶ οἱ βουκόλοι τῶν βοῶν καὶ οἱ ἱπποφορβοὶ τῶν ἵππων , καὶ πάντες δὲ οἱ καλούμενοι νομεῖς ὧν ἂν ἐπιστατῶσι ζῴων εἰκότως ἂν ἄρχοντες τούτων νομίζοιντο : πάσας τοίνυν ταύτας τὰς ἀγέλας ἐδοκοῦμεν ὁρᾶν μᾶλλον ἐθελούσας πείθεσθαι τοῖς νομεῦσιν ἢ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοῖς ἄρχουσι .	And in addition to this , we reflected that cowherds are the rulers of their cattle , that grooms are the rulers of their horses , and that all who are called herdsmen might properly be regarded as the rulers of the animals over which they are placed in charge . Now we noticed , as we thought , that all these herds obeyed their keepers more readily than men obey their rulers .	236	Moreover, we thought that both the herdsmen of the oxen and the keepers of the horses are rulers, and in general, all those who are called herdsmen of any animals they oversee would naturally be considered rulers of these animals. Thus, we seemed to observe that all these herds are more willing	And further, we used to remark that cowherds and shepherds and horse-herds are regarded as rulers of the cattle and horses and sheep over which they are placed in charge, but we thought that all these herds obeyed their keepers more willingly than men obey their rulers.	Moreover, we also consider that the herdsmen of cattle and the grooms of horses are indeed leaders, and all those called herdsmen of whatever animals they oversee would rightly be thought to be the rulers of these animals; therefore, we have observed that all these herds seem more willing to obey their herds	In addition, we thought that the shepherds of the cattle and the grooms of the horses are also rulers, and all those called shepherds of whatever animals they oversee, it is reasonable to think that they are rulers of these: therefore, we thought that we would see all these herds more willing to
πορεύονταί τε γὰρ αἱ ἀγέλαι ᾗ ἂν αὐτὰς εὐθύνωσιν οἱ νομεῖς , νέμονταί τε χωρία ἐφ᾽ ὁποῖα ἂν αὐτὰς ἐπάγωσιν , ἀπέχονταί τε ὧν ἂν αὐτὰς ἀπείργωσι : καὶ τοῖς καρποῖς τοίνυν τοῖς γιγνομένοις ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐῶσι τοὺς νομέας χρῆσθαι οὕτως ὅπως ἂν αὐτοὶ βούλωνται .	For the herds go wherever their keeper directs them and graze in those places to which he leads them and keep out of those from which he excludes them . They allow their keeper , moreover , to enjoy , just as he will , the profits that accrue from them .	237	The herds go wherever the herdsmen direct them, graze in whatever places they are led to, and keep away from those from which they are driven. And the herdsmen are allowed to use the produce from them as they wish.	For the herds go wherever the herdsmen guide them, and they graze in the places to which they are led, and they abstain from the places from which they are kept away; and the herdsmen are allowed to use the produce that comes from them in whatever way they wish.	For the herds go wherever the shepherds guide them, they graze in the pastures to which they are led, and they refrain from what they are prevented from accessing; and thus, they allow the shepherds to use the fruits that arise from them as they themselves wish.	The flocks are driven wherever the shepherds wish, they are pastured in whatever fields they are taken, and they are kept away from whatever fields they are excluded from. And so the shepherds are allowed to use the fruits that are produced from them as they wish.
ἔτι τοίνυν οὐδεμίαν πώποτε ἀγέλην ᾐσθήμεθα συστᾶσαν ἐπὶ τὸν νομέα οὔτε ὡς μὴ πείθεσθαι οὔτε ὡς μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν τῷ καρπῷ χρῆσθαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ χαλεπώτεραί εἰσιν αἱ ἀγέλαι πᾶσι τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις ἢ τοῖς ἄρχουσί τε καὶ ὠφελουμένοις ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν : ἄνθρωποι δὲ ἐπ᾽ οὐδένας μᾶλλον συνίστανται ἢ ἐπὶ τούτους οὓς ἂν αἴσθωνται ἄρχειν αὑτῶν ἐπιχειροῦντας .	And then again , we have never known of a herd conspiring against its keeper , either to refuse obedience to him or to deny him the privilege of enjoying the profits that accrue . At the same time , herds are more intractable to strangers than to their rulers and those who derive profit from them . Men , however , conspire against none sooner than against those whom they see attempting to rule over them .	238	Yet indeed, we have never perceived any herd gathering together against the herdsman, either to disobey him or to prevent him from using the fruits, but the herds are even harsher to all outsiders than to those who rule and benefit from them. But men gather together against none more than those whom they	But we have never yet noticed any herd of animals gathering together to attack their feeder, either to refuse obedience or to prevent him from making use of their wool or milk or any other service they may render; but herds are more troublesome to strangers than to their own masters and those who are benefited by them. But men	Moreover, we have never perceived any herd assembling around the herdsman, either as if they do not obey or as if they do not allow the use of the fruit, but the herds are even harsher to all the outsiders than to the rulers and those benefiting from them. And men unite with none more than	We have never yet seen a flock gathering on the pasture, either because they do not obey or because they do not allow the fruit to be used, but the flocks are more difficult for all foreigners than for those who rule and are benefited by them. But people gather more readily on those whom they feel are attempting to
ὅτε μὲν δὴ ταῦτα ἐνεθυμούμεθα , οὕτως ἐγιγνώσκομεν περὶ αὐτῶν , ὡς ἀνθρώπῳ πεφυκότι πάντων τῶν ἄλλων ῥᾷον εἴη ζῴων ἢ ἀνθρώπων ἄρχειν .	Thus , as we meditated on this analogy , we were inclined to conclude that for man , as he is constituted , it is easier to rule over any and all other creatures than to rule over men .	239	When we considered these things, we judged about them in this way, that for a person by nature it would be easier to rule all other animals than humans.	When we thought of this, we realized that for a man it was easier to rule any of the other animals than to rule men.	When we reflect on these things, we come to understand them as it is easier for a being naturally human to rule over all other animals than over other humans.	When we are thinking about this, we judge them as a man who is naturally more likely to rule over animals than over men.
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἐνενοήσαμεν ὅτι Κῦρος ἐγένετο Πέρσης , ὃς παμπόλλους μὲν ἀνθρώπους ἐκτήσατο πειθομένους αὑτῷ , παμπόλλας δὲ πόλεις , πάμπολλα δὲ ἔθνη , ἐκ τούτου δὴ ἠναγκαζόμεθα μετανοεῖν μὴ οὔτε τῶν ἀδυνάτων οὔτε τῶν χαλεπῶν ἔργων ᾖ τὸ ἀνθρώπων ἄρχειν , ἤν τις ἐπισταμένως τοῦτο πράττῃ .	But when we reflected that there was one Cyrus , the Persian , who reduced to obedience a vast number of men and cities and nations , we were then compelled to change our opinion and decide that to rule men might be a task neither impossible nor even difficult , if one should only go about it in an intelligent manner .	240	Since we perceived that Cyrus became a Persian, who acquired very many people obeying him, very many cities, and very many nations, from this we were compelled to change our mind that ruling over men is neither an impossible nor a difficult task, if one does it skillfully.	But when we reflected that Cyrus was a Persian, and that he became king of a vast territory and ruled over a multitude of men, and that he won this great power not by any inheritance but by his own efforts, we were induced to consider that it is not at all impossible that a man of virtue might easily win	Since we have considered that Cyrus became a Persian, who indeed acquired many people obedient to him, many cities, and many nations, thus we are compelled to repent, lest either the weak or the difficult deeds be such as to rule over humanity, if anyone should do this with knowledge.	Since, however, we have conceived that Cyrus became a Persian, who has won over many men to himself, many cities, and many nations, we are therefore compelled to repent that neither of the impossible nor of the difficult works is the rule of men, if anyone does this wisely.
Κύρῳ γοῦν ἴσμεν ἐθελήσαντας πείθεσθαι τοὺς μὲν ἀπέχοντας παμπόλλων ἡμερῶν ὁδόν , τοὺς δὲ καὶ μηνῶν , τοὺς δὲ οὐδ᾽ ἑωρακότας πώποτ᾽ αὐτόν , τοὺς δὲ καὶ εὖ εἰδότας ὅτι οὐδ᾽ ἂν ἴδοιεν , καὶ ὅμως ἤθελον αὐτῷ ὑπακούειν .	At all events , we know that people obeyed Cyrus willingly , although some of them were distant from him a journey of many days , and others of many months ; others , although they had never seen him , and still others who knew well that they never should see him . Nevertheless they were all willing to be his subjects .	241	"""At least we know that Cyrus succeeded in persuading some who were a journey of many days away, others of many months, some who had never seen him, and even some who were well aware that they would never see him, and yet they were willing to obey him."""	For we know that men were willing to obey Cyrus, some of them abandoning their homes and making the long journey to join him, some of them never having seen him before, some of them knowing well that they would never see him, and yet they were willing to obey him.	For indeed, we know that some, having abstained for many days from the journey, and some for months, and some who have never even seen him, and others who are well aware that they would not even be able to see him, still wanted to obey him.	We know that those who wanted to obey him were those who had been away for many days, those who had been away for months, those who had never seen him, and those who even knew that they would never see him, and yet they wanted to obey him.
καὶ τοίνυν τούτων τῶν ἐθνῶν ἦρξεν οὔτε αὐτῷ ὁμογλώττων ὄντων οὔτε ἀλλήλοις , καὶ ὅμως ἐδυνάσθη ἐφικέσθαι μὲν ἐπὶ τοσαύτην γῆν τῷ ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ φόβῳ , ὥστε καταπλῆξαι πάντας καὶ μηδένα ἐπιχειρεῖν αὐτῷ , ἐδυνάσθη δὲ ἐπιθυμίαν ἐμβαλεῖν τοσαύτην τοῦ πάντας αὐτῷ χαρίζεσθαι ὥστε ἀεὶ τῇ αὐτοῦ γνώμῃ ἀξιοῦν κυβερνᾶσθαι , ἀνηρτήσατο δὲ τοσαῦτα φῦλα ὅσα καὶ διελθεῖν ἔργον ἐστίν , ὅποι ἂν ἄρξηταί τις πορεύεσθαι ἀπὸ τῶν βασιλείων , ἤν τε πρὸς ἕω ἤν τε πρὸς ἑσπέραν ἤν τε πρὸς ἄρκτον ἤν τε πρὸς μεσημβρίαν .	He ruled over these nations , even though they did not speak the same language as he , nor one nation the same as another ; for all that , he was able to cover so vast a region with the fear which he inspired , that he struck all men with terror and no one tried to withstand him ; and he was able to awaken in all so lively a desire to please him , that they always wished to be guided by his will . Moreover , the tribes that he brought into subjection to himself were so many that it is a difficult matter even to travel to them all , in whatever direction one begin one ' s journey from the palace , whether toward the east or the west , toward the north or the south .	242	And so, he ruled over these nations, although they neither spoke the same language nor shared kinship with each other, and yet he was able to command such extensive territory through the fear he inspired, so as to astonish everyone and make no one dare to oppose him, and he was able to instill such a	And yet he was the ruler of these nations, neither of them speaking his language, nor one another's. Still he was able to cover so much ground and to strike such terror into all, that he prevented any from daring to make a move against him; and he was able to implant in all so lively a desire	And thus he began with these nations, neither being of the same language nor to each other, yet he was able to attain so much land through his own fear, to the extent that he struck all and no one dared to confront him. Furthermore, he was able to instill such a desire in all of them to	And so, of these nations, none was subject to him, either because they spoke the same language or because they were related to one another, and yet he was able to conquer so much land by his own fear, that he struck fear into all and no one dared to oppose him. He was also able to inspire

Believing this man to be deserving of all admiration , we have therefore investigated who he was in his origin , what natural endowments he possessed , and what sort of education he had enjoyed , that he so greatly excelled in governing men .	243	We indeed considered this man worthy of admiration, and inquired into what sort of lineage he was from, what nature he possessed, and what education he received that made him so distinguished in ruling people.	We, then, have inquired, as was fitting, who this man was in family, what natural endowments he had, and what sort of education he had enjoyed, that he became so superior to his fellow men in governing.	We have indeed considered this man as worthy of admiration, examining who he is, what kind of lineage he has, what nature he possesses, and by what kind of education he has been trained to such an extent as to reach the leadership of men.	We have therefore thought it worthy of admiration, to consider who this man was, of what family and of what nature he was, and what education he had received, that he should have risen to the position of ruling men.
ὅσα οὖν καὶ ἐπυθόμεθα καὶ ᾐσθῆσθαι δοκοῦμεν περὶ αὐτοῦ , ταῦτα πειρασόμεθα διηγήσασθαι .	Accordingly , what we have found out or think we know concerning him we shall now endeavour to present .	244	Therefore, whatever we have heard or seem to have perceived about it, we shall endeavor to narrate.	What we have heard, and what we think we have sensed about him, we will try to recount.	Therefore, whatever we have learned and seem to have perceived about him, we will attempt to recount these things.	So whatever we have been told and seem to know about him, we will try to tell.

They provide for such hunting out of the public treasury ; and as the king is their leader in war , so he not only takes part in the hunt himself but sees to it that the others hunt , too . The state bears the expense of the hunting for the reason that the training it gives seems to be the best preparation for war itself .	247	For this reason, they publicly take care of hunting, and the king is their leader just as in war, and he himself hunts and takes care that the others also hunt, because this practice seems to them to be the truest training for war.	For this reason they publicly take care of hunting, and the king is their leader in this as in war, and he himself hunts and takes care of the others, that they may hunt, because this pursuit seems to them to be the truest of those related to war.	For this reason, they take care of hunting publicly, and the king is their leader just as he is in war, both hunting himself and overseeing others so that they may hunt, since this practice seems to them to be the truest preparation for war.	Therefore, they take care of the hunting publicly, and the king is their leader, just as in war, and he himself hunts and takes care of the others so that they may hunt, because he thinks that this is the most important thing for them.
καὶ γὰρ πρῲ ἀνίστασθαι ἐθίζει καὶ ψύχη καὶ θάλπη ἀνέχεσθαι , γυμνάζει δὲ καὶ ὁδοιπορίαις καὶ δρόμοις , ἀνάγκη δὲ καὶ τοξεῦσαι θηρίον καὶ ἀκοντίσαι ὅπου ἂν παραπίπτῃ .	For it accustoms them to rise early in the morning and to endure both heat and cold , and it gives them practice in taking long tramps and runs , and they have to shoot or spear a wild beast whenever it comes in their way .	248	For it accustoms one to rise early and endure both cold and heat, and it also trains one through journeys and running, and there is a need to shoot at wild beasts and to hurl javelins wherever they may fall.	For it also accustoms him to rise early and to endure cold and heat, and it trains him in long marches and in running; and it compels him to shoot the wild beast with his bow and to throw the javelin where it will be most effective.	For it trains both the body and the spirit to rise early, and to endure cold and heat; it also instructs in travel and running, and it is necessary to hunt wild animals and throw a spear wherever one may happen upon them.	And for it is accustomed to rise early and to endure cold and heat, and it is exercised by journeys and runs, and it is necessary to hunt a beast and to throw a spear wherever it may fall.
καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν δὲ πολλάκις ἀνάγκη θήγεσθαι ὅταν τι τῶν ἀλκίμων θηρίων ἀνθιστῆται : παίειν μὲν γὰρ δήπου δεῖ τὸ ὁμόσε γιγνόμενον , φυλάξασθαι δὲ τὸ ἐπιφερόμενον : ὥστε οὐ ῥᾴδιον εὑρεῖν τί ἐν τῇ θήρᾳ ἄπεστι τῶν ἐν πολέμῳ παρόντων .	And they must often whet their courage when one of the fierce beasts shows fight ; for , of course , they must strike down the animal that comes to close quarters with them , and they must be on their guard against the one that threatens to attack them . In a word , it is not easy to find any quality required in war that is not required also in the chase .	249	And often it is necessary to sharpen the spirit when some fierce beast resists: for indeed one must strike that which approaches and guard against that which bears down; so it is not easy to find what in the hunt is absent of the things present in war.	And the soul too must often be pained when any of the fierce beasts resist: for it is necessary to strike what comes near, and to guard against what is approaching: so that it is not easy to find what is absent in the hunt of what is present in war.	And the soul must often be fortified whenever it is confronted by any of the fierce beasts: for certainly it must strike what is approaching, but guard against what is coming. Thus, it is not easy to find out what is absent in the hunt from those present in battle.	And the soul must often be led when some of the fierce beasts are stirred up: for it is necessary to play with what is happening together, and to guard what is coming: so that it is not easy to find out what is missing in the beast, of those who are present in the war.

Such then were the natural endowments , physical and spiritual , that he is reputed to have had ; but he was educated in conformity with the laws of the Persians ; and these laws appear in their care for the common weal not to start from the same point as they do in most states .	250	Having such a nature of form and soul, he is remembered: he was educated indeed in the laws of the Persians, and these laws seem to begin by taking care of the common good, not as in most cities.	He is remembered as having a nature of form and soul as follows: he was educated in the laws of the Persians; these laws seem to begin by taking care of the common good, not from where they start in most cities.	Indeed, having such a nature of form and soul is remembered: he was educated under the laws of the Persians; and these laws seem to govern with regard to the common good, unlike those in most cities, which are governed otherwise.

Having such a nature of form and soul is remembered: he was indeed educated in the laws of the Persians: these laws, however, seem to be based on the common good, and this is how most cities begin."

For most states permit every one to train his own children just as he will , and the older people themselves to live as they please ; and then they command them not to steal and not to rob , not to break into anybody ' s house , not to strike a person whom they have no right to strike , not to commit adultery , not to disobey an officer , and so forth ; and if a man transgress anyone one of these laws , they punish him .	251	For most cities have let each one educate their own children as they wish, and the older men also to live as they wish, then they command them not to steal or rob, not to enter a house by force, not to strike anyone unjustly, not to commit adultery, not to disobey the authorities	For most cities, having neglected to train their own citizens how they wish them to be, command them not to steal or plunder, not to break into houses, not to strike those they should not, not to commit adultery, not to disobey magistrates, and so on, and if someone does break one of these	For the most part, the cities allow individuals to educate their own children as they wish, and the elders as they desire to live; then they impose upon them not to steal or to plunder, not to enter a house by force, not to strike whom it is not just, not to commit adultery, not	Most cities leave people to educate their children as they wish and to live as they please, but then they order them not to steal, not to assault, not to break into a house by force, not to play unfairly, not to commit adultery, not to disobey a magistrate, and the rest of the things of

They take care of this in the following way. They have a place called the free market, where both the royal buildings and the other public buildings have been made	But the Persian laws try to take care that the citizens shall not be of such a character as to desire anything improper or base, and the guardians of the laws take care in the following way: there is a so-called free agora, where the royal palace and other government buildings are located.

They take care in this way: there is among them a free marketplace, called so, where both the royal buildings and other offices are established.

The hucksters with their wares , their cries , and their vulgarities are excluded from this and relegated to another part of the city , in order that their tumult may not intrude upon the orderly life of the cultured .	253	Hence, the wares, the market people, and their cries and vulgarities have been driven to another place, so that their tumult does not blend with the orderly conduct of the educated.	From here the wares and the merchants and the cries and the ungentlemanly language have been banished to another place, so that their tumult may not mingle with the decorum of the educated.	From here, the commodities, the market-goers, and their voices and boundless chatter were driven away to another place, so that the confusion of these might not mingle with the decorum of the educated.	From thence the rabble, and the market-people, and the cries and the endless noise of these, retired to another place, lest their tumult should mingle with the quietude of the educated.

And the laws require them to come daily to their several quarters — the boys and the full-grown men at daybreak ; but the elders may come at whatever time it suits each one ' s convenience , except that they must present themselves on certain specified days .	255	By law, each of these goes to their own regions, the children during the day and the mature men, and the elders whenever it is convenient for each of them, except on the appointed days when they must be present.

What is prescribed to each age we shall narrate, so that it may be more evident how much they care that the citizens may be as good as possible.
οἱ μὲν δὴ παῖδες εἰς τὰ διδασκαλεῖα φοιτῶντες διάγουσι μανθάνοντες δικαιοσύνην : καὶ λέγουσιν ὅτι ἐπὶ τοῦτο ἔρχονται ὥσπερ παρ᾽ ἡμῖν ὅτι γράμματα μαθησόμενοι .	The boys go to school and spend their time in learning justice ; and they say that they go there for this purpose , just as in our country they say that they go to learn to read and write .	260	The boys indeed go to the schools and spend their time learning justice; and they say that they come for this purpose just as among us they come to learn letters.	The boys go to school and spend their time in learning justice: and they say that they go there for this purpose, just as to our schools to learn letters.	The children indeed, attending the schools, spend their time learning justice: and they say that they come for this reason, just as we do, to learn letters.	The boys, going to school, walk learning justice: and they say that they come for this as we do for learning letters.
οἱ δ᾽ ἄρχοντες αὐτῶν διατελοῦσι τὸ πλεῖστον τῆς ἡμέρας δικάζοντες αὐτοῖς .	And their officers spend the greater part of the day in deciding cases for them .	261	Their rulers spend most of the day judging them.	and their magistrates spend the whole day in deciding cases between citizens.	Their rulers spend most of the day judging them.	The leaders of them spend most of the day judging them.
γίγνεται γὰρ δὴ καὶ παισὶ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ὥσπερ ἀνδράσιν ἐγκλήματα καὶ κλοπῆς καὶ ἁρπαγῆς καὶ βίας καὶ ἀπάτης καὶ κακολογίας καὶ ἄλλων οἵων δὴ εἰκός . οὓς δ᾽ ἂν γνῶσι τούτων τι ἀδικοῦντας , τιμωροῦνται .	For , as a matter of course , boys also prefer charges against one another , just as men do , of theft , robbery , assault , cheating , slander , and other things that naturally come up ; and when they discover any one committing any of these crimes , they punish him ,	262	For indeed even among children there arise charges against one another of theft and robbery and violence and deceit and slander and all such things as are likely. And when they find anyone guilty of doing these things, they punish them.	For even among children there are accusations against each other of wrongdoing, of theft and violence and assault and deceit and slander and other such things as are natural; and when they think they are being wronged, they are angry and avenge themselves.	For indeed, it happens that children commit offenses against one another just as men do, such as crimes, thefts, pillaging, violence, deceit, slander, and other such things that are likely. Those whom they know to be guilty of any of these are punished.	Children are also guilty of crimes against each other, such as theft, robbery, violence, deception, slander, and other things that are likely. Those who are found guilty of these things are punished.
κολάζουσι δὲ καὶ ὃν ἂν ἀδίκως ἐγκαλοῦντα εὑρίσκωσι .	and they punish also any one whom they find accusing another falsely .	263	They also punish anyone they find making an unjust accusation.	They also punish anyone whom they find bringing an unjust accusation.	They also punish anyone they find accusing unjustly.	They also punish anyone they find guilty of unjust accusations.
δικάζουσι δὲ καὶ ἐγκλήματος οὗ ἕνεκα ἄνθρωποι μισοῦσι μὲν ἀλλήλους μάλιστα , δικάζονται δὲ ἥκιστα , ἀχαριστίας , καὶ ὃν ἂν γνῶσι δυνάμενον μὲν χάριν ἀποδιδόναι , μὴ ἀποδιδόντα δέ , κολάζουσι καὶ τοῦτον ἰσχυρῶς .	And they bring one another to trial also charged with an offence for which people hate one another most but go to law least , namely , that of ingratitude ; and if they know that any one is able to return a favour and fails to do so , they punish him also severely .	264	They also give judgment for a crime for which people especially hate each other but judge the least, ingratitude; and whoever they discover able to return a favor but not doing so, they severely punish.	They also try cases of misconduct, which are brought against those who have been guilty of some violation of duty to the gods or to their parents or to the state; and they also try cases in which the prosecutor argues that the defendant has done some wrong to him and, owing to the lowness of his own estate	They also judge crimes for which people primarily hate each other, but they are judged very rarely, for ingratitude; and whoever they know to be able to give a favor but does not give it, they punish him severely.	They judge for crimes, for which men hate each other most, but they are judged least, for ingratitude, and for him whom they know to be able to repay a favour, but not repaying it, they punish him severely.
οἴονται γὰρ τοὺς ἀχαρίστους καὶ περὶ θεοὺς ἂν μάλιστα ἀμελῶς ἔχειν καὶ περὶ γονέας καὶ πατρίδα καὶ φίλους . ἕπεσθαι δὲ δοκεῖ μάλιστα τῇ ἀχαριστίᾳ ἡ ἀναισχυντία : καὶ γὰρ αὕτη μεγίστη δοκεῖ εἶναι ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ αἰσχρὰ ἡγεμών .	For they think that the ungrateful are likely to be most neglectful of their duty toward their gods , their parents , their country , and their friends ; for it seems that shamelessness goes hand in hand with ingratitude ; and it is that , we know , which leads the way to every moral wrong .	265	For they think that the ungrateful would be especially negligent concerning the gods, as well as concerning parents, country, and friends. Shamelessness seems to follow ungratefulness most closely: for it appears to be the greatest leader towards all shameful acts.	For they think that the ungrateful would be most neglectful of the gods, and of parents, and of country, and of friends. And shamelessness seems to follow ingratitude; for a man who is ungrateful is also shameless.	For they believe that the ungrateful are most negligent regarding gods, parents, homeland, and friends. And it seems that shamelessness particularly follows ingratitude; for this appears to be the greatest leader in all shameful matters.	They think that the ungrateful are especially careless about gods, and about parents, and country, and friends. And it seems that cowardice is especially a companion to ingratitude: for this is considered the greatest of all shameful things.
διδάσκουσι δὲ τοὺς παῖδας καὶ σωφροσύνην : μέγα δὲ συμβάλλεται εἰς τὸ μανθάνειν σωφρονεῖν αὐτοὺς ὅτι καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ὁρῶσιν ἀνὰ πᾶσαν ἡμέραν σωφρόνως διάγοντας .	They teach the boys self-control also ; and it greatly conduces to their learning self-control that they see their elders also living temperately day by day .	266	They also teach the children moderation: and it greatly contributes to their learning moderation that they see the elders every day conducting themselves with moderation.	They also teach the boys self-control: a great contribution to their learning self-control is the fact that they see their elders behaving themselves with dignity every day.	They teach the children moderation; and it greatly contributes to their learning to be moderate that they see the elders living moderately every day.	They teach the children temperance: and it greatly helps them to learn to be temperate, because they see the elders living temperately every day.
διδάσκουσι δὲ αὐτοὺς καὶ πείθεσθαι τοῖς ἄρχουσι : μέγα δὲ καὶ εἰς τοῦτο συμβάλλεται ὅτι ὁρῶσι τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους πειθομένους τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ἰσχυρῶς .	And they teach them likewise to obey the officers ; and it greatly conduces to this also that they see their elders implicitly obeying their officers .	267	They teach them to obey the rulers; it also greatly contributes to this that they see the elders strongly obeying the rulers.	They also teach them to obey their rulers: and this is greatly conducive to it, that they see their elders obeying their rulers intently.	They teach them to obey the rulers; and a great factor contributing to this is that they see the elders strongly obeying the rulers.	They are also taught to obey the rulers. And it is a great thing that they see the elders obeying the rulers strongly.
διδάσκουσι δὲ καὶ ἐγκράτειαν γαστρὸς καὶ ποτοῦ : μέγα δὲ καὶ εἰς τοῦτο συμβάλλεται ὅτι ὁρῶσι τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους οὐ πρόσθεν ἀπιόντας γαστρὸς ἕνεκα πρὶν ἂν ἀφῶσιν οἱ ἄρχοντες , καὶ ὅτι οὐ παρὰ μητρὶ σιτοῦνται οἱ παῖδες , ἀλλὰ παρὰ τῷ διδασκάλῳ , ὅταν οἱ ἄρχοντες σημήνωσι .	And besides , they teach them self-restraint in eating and drinking ; and it greatly conduces to this also that they see that their elders do not leave their post to satisfy their hunger until the officers dismiss them ; and the same end is promoted by the fact that the boys do not eat with their mothers but with their teachers , from the time the officers so direct .	268	They also teach self-control of the stomach and drink; and a great contribution to this is that they see the elders do not leave because of hunger before the rulers dismiss them, and that the children do not eat with their mother, but with the teacher when the rulers signal.	They also teach them to control the appetite, and to eat and drink only what they are told to. And they bring forward as a great proof of this, that when they are at supper, the dishes are placed before the boys, and they pass them on to the men without touching them; not because they abstain	They teach self-control regarding food and drink: and it greatly contributes to this that they see the elders not departing for the sake of their bellies before the rulers signal, and that the children do not ask for food from their mothers, but from the teacher, when the rulers indicate.	They also teach temperance of the belly and drink: and a great deal is contributed to this that they see the elders not going out before they have left the belly full, and that the children are not fed by their mothers, but by the teacher, when the rulers give the signal.
φέρονται δὲ οἴκοθεν σῖτον μὲν ἄρτον , ὄψον δὲ κάρδαμον , πιεῖν δέ , ἤν τις διψῇ , κώθωνα , ὡς ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἀρύσασθαι .	Furthermore , they bring from home bread for their food , cress for a relish , and for drinking , if any one is thirsty , a cup to draw water from the river .	269	They carry from home bread as food, watercress as relish, and to drink, if anyone is thirsty, a cup to draw from the river.	They bring from home barley bread for food, cardamom for relish, and for drink, if anyone is thirsty, a gourd, that they may scoop up water from the river.	They bring from home bread as food, and for a side dish, cardamom; and for drinking, if anyone is thirsty, they provide a water jar, as if drawn from the river.	They are fed at home with barley bread and pulse, and when thirsty, they drink from the river.
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις μανθάνουσι καὶ τοξεύειν καὶ ἀκοντίζειν .	Besides this , they learn to shoot and to throw the spear .	270	In addition to these things, they learn to shoot with a bow and to throw a javelin.	In addition to these, they also learn archery and spear-throwing.	Moreover, they learn both archery and throwing spears.	In addition, they also learn to shoot and throw javelins.
μέχρι μὲν δὴ ἓξ ἢ ἑπτακαίδεκα ἐτῶν ἀπὸ γενεᾶς οἱ παῖδες ταῦτα πράττουσιν , ἐκ τούτου δὲ εἰς τοὺς ἐφήβους ἐξέρχονται .	This , then , is what the boys do until they are sixteen or seventeen years of age , and after this they are promoted from the class of boys and enrolled among the young men .	271	Until the age of sixteen or seventeen from birth, the children do these things, and from then on they enter into youth.	Up to the age of six or seven they are called children and serve as attendants in the temples, but after this they are classed among the youths.	Until the age of six or seventeen, children engage in these activities, and from this point, they transition into adolescence.	Until they are six or seventeen years old, the boys do these things, but from then on they become young men.
οὗτοι δ᾽ αὖ οἱ ἔφηβοι διάγουσιν ὧδε . δέκα ἔτη ἀφ᾽ οὗ ἂν ἐκ παίδων ἐξέλθωσι κοιμῶνται μὲν περὶ τὰ ἀρχεῖα , ὥσπερ προειρήκαμεν , καὶ φυλακῆς ἕνεκα τῆς πόλεως καὶ σωφροσύνης : δοκεῖ γὰρ αὕτη ἡ ἡλικία μάλιστα ἐπιμελείας δεῖσθαι : παρέχουσι δὲ καὶ τὴν ἡμέραν ἑαυτοὺς τοῖς ἄρχουσι χρῆσθαι ἤν τι δέωνται ὑπὲρ τοῦ κοινοῦ .	Now the young men in their turn live as follows : for ten years after they are promoted from the class of boys they pass the nights , as we said before , about the government buildings . This they do for the sake of guarding the city and of developing their powers of self-control ; for this time of life , it seems , demands the most watchful care . And during the day , too , they put themselves at the disposal of the authorities , if they are needed for any service to the state .	272	But these young men spend their time in this way: for ten years after they leave boyhood, they sleep around the public offices, as we have previously stated, both for the protection of the city and for their own discipline. For it is thought that this age especially requires supervision. They also make themselves available to the	These, then, are the young men, and they live in this way. For ten years after they have come out of the class of boys they sleep about the public buildings, as we said before, both for the sake of guarding the city and of practicing self-control; for during this time they are still watched by	These young men, however, are living in this way. For ten years after they leave childhood, they sleep around the archons, as we have previously mentioned, both for the sake of the city’s security and for their own moderation: for this age seems to require the most care. They also provide themselves during the	These young men, however, are here. Ten years after they leave childhood, they sleep near the archives, as we have said, and for the sake of the city and their own self-control: for this age seems to require the most care. They also spend their day serving the rulers, whenever they are needed for
καὶ ὅταν μὲν δέῃ , πάντες μένουσι περὶ τὰ ἀρχεῖα : ὅταν δὲ ἐξίῃ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ θήραν , ἐξάγει τὴν ἡμίσειαν τῆς φυλακῆς : ποιεῖ δὲ τοῦτο πολλάκις τοῦ μηνός .	Whenever it is necessary , they all remain about the public buildings . But when the king goes out hunting , he takes out half the garrison ; and this he does many times a month .	273	And whenever it is necessary, all stay around the archives: but whenever the king goes out for hunting, he takes half of the guard with him: and he does this many times a month.	and when there is need, all remain about the public buildings; when the king goes out to hunt, he takes out the half of the guard: he does this many times in the month.	And when it is necessary, all remain regarding the archives; but when the king goes out for hunting, he exercises half of the guard; and he does this many times during the month.	And when it is necessary, all stay around the archives: but when the king goes out hunting, he takes out half of the guard: and he does this many times a month.
ἔχειν δὲ δεῖ τοὺς ἐξιόντας τόξα καὶ παρὰ τὴν φαρέτραν ἐν κολεῷ κοπίδα ἢ σάγαριν , ἔτι δὲ γέρρον καὶ παλτὰ δύο , ὥστε τὸ μὲν ἀφεῖναι , τῷ δ᾽ , ἂν δέῃ , ἐκ χειρὸς χρῆσθαι .	Those who go must take bow and arrows and , in addition to the quiver , a sabre or bill in its scabbard ; they carry along also a light shield and two spears , on to throw , the other to use in case of necessity in a hand-to-hand encounter .	274	But those departing must have bows and, besides the quiver, a sword in a scabbard or a battle-axe, and also a wicker shield and two javelins, so that one can be thrown and the other, if necessary, used in hand-to-hand combat.

They must have bows and a sword or a dagger at their belt, and a spear and two javelins, so that they may leave them behind, but be able to use them if necessary.
